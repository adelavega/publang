      Abstract\n \nOne important aspect for managing social interactions is the ability
      to perceive and respond to facial expressions rapidly and accurately. This ability
      is highly dependent upon intact processing within both cortical and subcortical
      components of the early visual pathways. Social cognitive deficits, including
      face emotion recognition (FER) deficits, are characteristic of several neuropsychiatric
      disorders including schizophrenia (Sz) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD).
      Here, we investigated potential visual sensory contributions to FER deficits
      in Sz (  n   = 28, 8/20 female/male; age 2154 years) and adult ASD (  n   =
      20, 4/16 female/male; age 1943 years) participants compared to neurotypical
      (  n   = 30, 8/22 female/male; age 1954 years) controls using task-based fMRI
      during an implicit static/dynamic FER task. Compared to neurotypical controls,
      both Sz (  d   = 1.97) and ASD (  d   = 1.13) participants had significantly
      lower FER scores which interrelated with diminished activation of the superior
      temporal sulcus (STS). In Sz, STS deficits were predicted by reduced activation
      of early visual regions (  d   = 0.85,   p   = 0.002) and of the pulvinar nucleus
      of the thalamus (  d   = 0.44,   p   = 0.042), along with impaired cortico-pulvinar
      interaction. By contrast, ASD participants showed patterns of increased early
      visual cortical (  d   = 1.03,   p   = 0.001) and pulvinar (  d   = 0.71,   p   =
      0.015) activation. Large effect-size structural and histological abnormalities
      of pulvinar have previously been documented in Sz. Moreover, we have recently
      demonstrated impaired pulvinar activation to simple visual stimuli in Sz. Here,
      we provide the first demonstration of a disease-specific contribution of impaired
      pulvinar activation to social cognitive impairment in Sz. \n \n\n# Body\n \n##
      Introduction \n  \nSocial cognitive deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia
      (Sz) ( ) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and contribute to impaired functional
      outcome ( ;  ). One important aspect of social functioning is the ability to
      rapidly and accurately perceive facial expressions. Impaired face-emotion recognition
      (FER) has been extensively reported in Sz ( ;  ) and ASD ( ;  ;  ) however the
      underlying neuronal substrates of these deficits are not fully understood and,
      indeed, may arise from differential underlying neural pathologies ( ). Over
      recent years, the contribution of sensory-processing deficits to cognitive impairments
      has been increasingly appreciated ( ;  ), including the potential role of dysfunction
      within subcortical components of the afferent visual streams ( ;  ). Here, we
      utilize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate the contributions
      of impaired early sensory processing to FER impairments in Sz. Data were collected
      as well from both neurotypical and ASD comparison groups to assess the specificity
      and magnitude of observed activation deficits in Sz. \n\nDuring normative brain
      function, FER is supported by activation of specific components of the social
      brain( ), which includes structures along both the dorsal and ventral visual-cortical
      pathways ( ;  ;  ). These pathways receive retinal information from the lateral
      geniculate nucleus (LGN), which projects to primary visual cortex (V1). The
      dorsal pathway receives its primary input from the magnocellular geniculostriate
      pathway and is specialized for rapid detection of low spatial-frequency and
      motion information. Key dorsal structures include motion-sensitive mid-temporal
      regions (MT, MST). In Sz, differential deficits in magnocellular processing
      have been reported and related to potentially impaired patterns of sensory gain
      and functions of the N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (NMDAR) (reviewed
      in  ). Moreover, impairments in magnocellular function correlate with behavioral
      measures of impaired FER in Sz, supporting the involvement of this pathway in
      social cognition ( ,  ;  ). By contrast, the ventral visual stream receives
      predominant input from the subcortical parvocellular system and is specialized
      for slower but higher-resolution processing of stimulus details. Key targets
      of the ventral stream include visual area V4 and the fusiform face complex (FFC).
      \n\nAlong with the ventral and dorsal pathways, the presence of an anatomically
      and functionally distinct third pathway specialized for social perception and
      comprising the superior temporal sulcus (STS) region, has recently been proposed
      ( ). The STS region has been reliably associated with processing biological
      motion signals ( ;  ;  ) including dynamic social cues such as the changeable
      aspects of facial features (eyes, lips). Impaired STS activation has been documented
      in Sz but the basis for the deficit remains unknown ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ). \n\nIn
      addition to the cortical system, humans retain an evolutionarily old retinotectal
      system that mediates non-conscious affective processing   via   amygdala, superior
      colliculus and the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus (PulN) (reviewed in  ).
      In addition to mediating retinogeniculate input into visual cortex, PulN also
      mediates cortico-cortical interactions between successive brain regions within
      the dorsal and ventral stream pathways (e.g.,  ), and is the site of greatest
      NMDAR density within primate thalamus ( ). \n\nPulN is anatomically divided
      into discrete, functionally differentiated subdivisions (e.g.,  ;  ). For example,
      the visual pulvinar, consisting of its inferior (PI) and lateral (PL) subdivisions,
      has dense connections with early visual sensory regions ( ) and likely plays
      a modulatory role in visual information processing ( ). In addition, projections
      from PI specifically innervate motion sensitive regions surrounding area MT,
      especially MST ( ), and also serve as drivers to secondary areas of visual cortex
      (e.g., V2) and as modulators to V1 ( ). On the other hand, medial pulvinar (PM)
      is considered multimodal and is primarily coupled with prefrontal and temporal
      regions including STS ( ) and may play a unique role in processing emotional
      information (reviewed in  ). \n\nHere, we evaluate whole-brain fMRI activation
      patterns during FER in Sz, relative to both neurotypical individuals and ASD.
      Inclusion of ASD participants is based on a previous study involving simple
      visual stimuli in which we observed a divergent pattern of disturbance within
      early visual areas and PulN relative to Sz patients, despite similar magnitude
      of FER impairment ( ). We hypothesized that, in Sz, deficits within FER-related
      higher tier visual regions (e.g., STS) would be driven significantly by impaired
      activation of both early visual regions (e.g., V1, MST) and PulN as well as
      by impaired cortico-pulvinar interactions. Moreover, we hypothesized that deficit
      patterns would be differential across Sz and ASD participants despite similar
      levels of behavioral impairment, suggesting disorder-specific pathophysiological
      mechanisms underlying social cognitive impairments in neuropsychiatric populations.
      \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nSeventy-eight participants
      took part, including 28 participants (age range 2154 years) diagnosed with schizophrenia
      (Sz) using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV ( ), 20 adults with
      autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (age range 1943 years), confirmed by the Autism
      Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition, and 30 neurotypical controls
      (age range 1954 years) ( ). All Sz participants were on a stable dose of antipsychotic
      medication. All participants had at least 20/22 corrected visual acuity on a
      Logarithmic Visual Acuity Chart. On average, Sz participants were older [  F  (1,
      56) = 7.24,   p   = 0.009] and had lower IQ scores [  F  (1, 56) = 6.54,   p   =
      0.013] than controls. All ASD participants and a subset of 19 Sz and 17 controls
      participated in our previous EEG/fMRI study of visual sensory dysfunction as
      reported in  , which did not include data from the present paradigm. Participants
      were recruited from the central research database and volunteer recruitment
      pool at the Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research (NKI). The investigation
      was approved by the Nathan Kline Institute (NKI) institutional review board.
      Informed consent was obtained from all participants. \n  \nParticipant characteristics.
      \n    \n\n### Paradigm \n  \nUnique video clips of five actors (three male)
      dynamically expressing each of four emotions (happy, sad, angry, fearful) were
      selected from the University of Cambridge Mind Reading Emotions Library (adult
      level 6) ( ). Five additional actors (two male) from the NKI community acted
      a neutral expression consisting of non-emotionally salient head/eye movements
      (left/right, up/down). Neutral videos were matched in size, resolution and luminance
      to emotion videos. For each video, representative single frames were extracted
      and used as corresponding static stimuli. Both dynamic and static stimuli were
      presented for 2 s each followed by a 400 ms interstimulus interval (ISI). In
      each of two 7.5-min fMRI scans, dynamic and static stimuli of a single emotion
      or neutral were delivered in 12-s blocks (5 stimuli per block), interleaved
      with 10-s of fixation-only. A total of ten blocks of static and 10 blocks of
      dynamic faces were presented in random order per scan ( ). Across both scans
      a total of 200 stimuli were delivered, 20 of each of four emotions plus neutral,
      either dynamic or static. To ascertain that participants were attending the
      stimuli, participants responded by button press to a single predesignated actor
      chosen randomly for each participant, irrespective of emotion or motion. The
      target actor appeared in 10% of all stimuli. \n  \n (A)   Schematic of fMRI
      paradigm. A total of 20 blocks lasting 12 s each were delivered in random order
      in each of two fMRI scans. Each block consisted of faces expressing a single
      emotion (happy, sad, angry, fear) or neutral expression either dynamically or
      statically.   (B)   FER accuracy determined in the behavioral paradigm administered
      outside the scanner, for dynamic (filled bars) and static (open) faces in control
      (CTL; blue), schizophrenia (SZ; orange), and autism (ASD; green). Relative to
      the CTL group, FER accuracy was significantly lower in the SZ and ASD groups
      for both dynamic (left bars) and static (right) faces. In SZ patients, FER accuracy
      for dynamic faces was especially reduced, relative to control participants.   (C)   Mean
      FER accuracy as a function of face-emotion and (below) sample stimuli used for
      happy, sad, angry and fear emotions. FER accuracy did not differ overall as
      a function of face-emotion and group membership.   (D)   Groupwise scores on
      the Penn Emotion Recognition (ER-40) test. As expected, both SZ and ASD participants
      had significantly lower ER-40 scores compared to the CTL group, which,   (E)   were
      correlated with accuracy on the FER task. In all cases, significance of group
      differences is denoted by asterisks, relative to CTL (*  p   < 0.05; **  p   <
      0.01;***  p   < 0.005). \n  \n\n### Behavior Measures \n  \nA forced-choice
      behavioral task was administered following the fMRI scan using the same static
      and dynamic emotional face stimuli (80 stimuli total, 20 of each type; neutral
      faces were not included). As in the fMRI scan, each static/dynamic stimulus
      was presented for 2 s. After each presentation, subjects were prompted to press
      one of five buttons to indicate if the actors expression was (1) happy, (2)
      sad, (3) angry, (4) fearful, or (5) none of the above. Accuracy, as opposed
      to response time was emphasized. The trial ended when subjects responded. To
      compare findings from our FER paradigm with those from a validated and reliable
      measure of FER, the Penn Emotion Recognition test (ER-40) ( ) was also administered
      to all participants and its results compared to those of the present FER paradigm.
      The ER-40 uses forty color photographs of faces expressing four basic emotionshappiness,
      sadness, anger, or fearplus neutralwith eight photographs for each category,
      presented in random order. Participants were instructed to choose the correct
      emotion from among the five listed choices (forced choice) by clicking a computer
      mouse as quickly as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Each image was displayed
      until a choice was made. \n\n\n### Functional Imaging \n  \nImaging took place
      on a Siemens 3T TiM Trio scanner. Two-hundred-twenty T2*-weighted echo-planar
      images (EPIs) (  TR   = 2,000 ms;   TE   = 30 ms;   FA   = 90; FOV = 240 mm;
      slice thickness = 2.8 mm) were acquired on each of 36 contiguous slices in the
      axial plane. At least one high-resolution structural image of the entire brain
      was acquired from each participant using an MPRAGE sequence (  TR   = 2500 ms;   TE   =
      3.5 ms; FOV = 256 mm, slice thickness = 1.0 mm, 192 slices). \n\nIndividual
      cortical surfaces were rendered from the high-resolution anatomical images using
      Freesurfer and registered to the std 0.141 fsaverage mesh ( ) with SUMA.  The
      pulvinar and amygdala were derived individually using a Bayesian atlas-based
      automated segmentation methods ( ;  ;  ) incorporated in Freesurfer. Functional
      data were preprocessed and analyzed using the Analysis of Functional NeuroImages
      (AFNI) software ( ;  ). Preprocessing consisted of concatenating data from two
      runs, removal of signal deviation >2.5 SDs from the mean (AFNIs 3dDespike),
      temporal alignment, identification of motion outliers per run and scaling of
      blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) values to mean percent signal change ( ).
      For surface-based analyses, the data was spatially smoothed with a 6 mm full
      width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. Single-participant statistical analyses
      were conducted within the framework of the general linear model (GLM). The GLM
      model included regressors for each stimulus type (emotional dynamic, emotional
      static, neutral dynamic, neutral static) as well as regressors for the six motion
      parameters (three rotations, three translations) and their first derivatives,
      per run. Time points with large head motion between successive time points were
      censored. Surface-based analyses were carried out on the gray-matter ordinates
      of each individual cortical surface aligned to the Freesurfer 141-standard mesh.
      Cortical data was sampled to the Human Connectome Project multimodal cortical
      parcellation (HCP-MMP1.0) ( ), resampled to fsaverage, which delineates 180
      brain parcels per hemisphere based on functional and structural properties.
      To assess activation of pulvinar and amygdala, analyses were conducted in the
      individual native-space volumes. Primary analyses involved the entire pulvinar.
      In secondary analyses, beta parameters were extracted from pulvinar subdivisions
      and tested separately. \n\nTo avoid issues related to circularity in data analysis
      ( ), activated parcels were first identified by an unpaired   t  -test of mean
      activation (vs. 0), collapsed over all stimuli, across all seventy-eight participants
      thresholded at an (uncorrected)   p  -value of 0.001 ( ). This analysis defined
      a mask consisting of 35 bilateral parcels (70 parcels total) ( ) in the HCP
      MMP1.0 parcellation atlas which was used in subsequent analyses of functional
      data.   lists each parcel. \n  \n (A)   Whole-brain beta parameter maps of activation
      elicited by all stimuli and across all participants, superimposed on the template
      brain with borders of HCP parcels demarcated.   (B)   Thirty-five parcels with
      significant activation collapsed across subjects and face stimuli. \n    \nMean
      beta parameter values in each of the 35 HCP-MMP1.0 ( ) parcels shown in   for
      the control (CTL), schizophrenia (SZ), and autism (ASD) groups. \n    \n\n###
      General Statistics \n  \nMean beta parameter estimates were extracted from individual
      parcels and entered into an omnibus repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)
      collapsing over all parcels identified as having significant across-group activation
      (  n   = 35 parcels per hemisphere,  ). Diagnostic group (control, Sz, ASD)
      was included as a between-subject factor. Face-motion type (dynamic, static)
      and face-emotion type (emotional, neutral) were included as within-subject factors.
      To minimize concerns regarding multiple comparisons, follow-up tests on individual
      parcels were conducted only if the initial group X parcel interaction was significant.
      Pre-planned subcortical regions (PulN, amygdala) were evaluated in separate
      ANOVAs with factors group, face-motion and face-emotion. \n\nEffect sizes of
      between-group differences were calculated using Cohens   d   (mean/std dev).
      \n\nThe interrelationship between behavioral measures of FER and cortical/subcortical
      activation patterns was assessed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with group
      membership as the categorical factor. Follow up ANCOVAs were conducted in a
      sequential fashion, for each significant covariate effect obtained in the prior
      analysis. In each case, only a single ANCOVA was performed for the region being
      tested as the dependent variable with all remaining covariates. The covariate
      x group interaction was used to evaluate group differences in the relationship
      between covariates. \n\nAll statistics were two-tailed with preset  level for
      significance of   p   < 0.05. \n\n\n### Mediation Analyses \n  \nBased on our
      prior findings ( ), we used exploratory linear mediation analyses to explore
      the role of PulN subdivisions and cortical activation patterns in Sz patients.
      Analyses were conducted within SPSS26  using the PROCESS macro ( ). A three-variable
      path model (model 4) was used to examine the predictor-outcome relationship
      between interrelated regions with impaired activation in Sz (relative to controls)
      and the potential mediating role of each PulN subdivision (PL, PI, PM). As per
      standard conventions, the link between the predictor and mediator variable is
      referred to as path   a  , and that between the mediator and the outcome (controlling
      for the predictor), is path   b  . The overall predictor-outcome relationship
      is effect   c  , and the direct effect, after controlling for the mediator is,   c  .
      The indirect (mediation) effect is the product of a*b and tests the significance
      of   c  c  . Statistical significance of indirect pathways, reflecting the impact
      of mediation, was evaluated using a nonparametric bootstrap approach with 10,000
      replication samples to obtain a 95% confidence interval (CI) ( ). The mediation
      effects were considered statistically significant if the bootstrapped 95% CI
      did not include zero. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavior \n  \nOverall, FER
      accuracy was significantly lower in both Sz [  F  (1, 56) = 15.02,   p   < 0.001]
      and ASD participants [  F  (1, 48) = 7.67,   p   = 0.009] compared to controls
      but did not differ between Sz and ASD [  F  (1, 46) = 0.03,   p   = 0.863] participants
      ( ). \n\nAcross groups, FER accuracy was equivalent for dynamic and static faces
      [  F  (1, 75) = 0.314,   p   = 0.576], however, the group x face-motion interaction
      was significant [  F  (2, 75) = 8.26,   p   < 0.001], reflecting relatively
      greater deficits for processing dynamic faces in Sz patients compared to controls
      [  F  (1, 56) = 11.70,   p   = 0.001;   d   = 1.4 dynamic faces;   d   = 0.82
      static faces]. Consequently, mean FER accuracy for dynamic vs. static faces
      was significantly lower in the Sz group [  t  (54) = 2.65,   p   = 0.010] but
      did not differ within either the ASD [  t  (38) = 1.01,   p   = 0.317] nor control
      [  t  (58) = 0.55,   p   = 0.584]. \n\nFER accuracy did not differ overall as
      a function of specific face-emotion type [  F  (6, 146) = 0.84,   p   = 0.541]
      ( ). \n\nAs expected, ER-40 scores were also lower in both Sz [  F  (1, 56)
      = 36.58,   p   < 0.001] and ASD [  F  (1, 48) = 24.57,   p   < 0.001] subjects
      compared to control participants ( ). Further, across subjects, ER-40 scores
      significantly predicted mean accuracy on the FER task [  F  (1, 74) = 8.22,   p   =
      0.005;   R   = 0.407] ( ). \n\nLastly, behavioral performance on the identity
      recognition task during fMRI was marginally worse in Sz [  F  (1, 56) = 3.76,   p   =
      0.058] and significantly worse in ASD [  F  (1, 48) = 4.52,   p   = 0.039] compared
      to controls. \n\n\n### Between-Group Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Activation
      Differences \n  \n#### Cortical Surface \n  \nAn initial omnibus analysis was
      carried out across all parcels in the mask (listed in  ) in order to test the
      null hypothesis that there were no significant activation differences across
      groups. The null hypothesis was falsified by the finding of a significant group
      x parcel interaction [  F  (68, 80) = 1.78,   p   = 0.007]. By contrast, the
      main effect of group membership was non-significant [  F  (2, 73) = 0.106,   p   =
      0.899]. These findings were interpreted as indicating that activation of some,
      but not all, parcels differed significantly in activation across groups ( ).
      \n\nFollow-up analyses were therefore conducted to determine which parcels most
      contributed to the significant interaction effect observed in the omnibus test.
      The goal of these analyses was to identify regions that were most likely to
      contribute to between-group differences in behavioral task-performance. Therefore,
      these analyses were not considered to increase family-wise error rates. \n\nIn
      these protected follow-up analyses, significant main effects of group membership
      were obtained in seven parcels (V1,V2, MST, FFC, TPOJ1, STSdp, FEF) encompassing
      early visual areas [V1:   F  (2, 75) = 4.38,   p   = 0.016; V2:   F  (2, 75)
      = 4.49,   p   = 0.014]; motion-sensitive, medial superior temporal cortex [MST:   F  (2,
      75) = 3.95,   p   = 0.023], fusiform face complex [FFC:   F  (2, 75) = 3.62,   p   =
      0.032]; frontal eye fields [FEF:   F  (2, 75) = 3.63,   p   = 0.031] and the
      posterior superior-temporal cortex including the temporo-parietal junction [TPOJ1:   F  (2,
      75) = 6.88,   p   = 0.002] and the dorsal posterior bank of the superior temporal
      sulcus [STSdp:   F  (2, 75) = 3.16,   p   = 0.048] ( , highlighted parcels;  ).
      \n  \n (A)   Localization of key parcels with overall group differences: early
      visual areas V1 and V2; medial superior temporal cortex (MST); fusiform face

      and dorsal posterior superior temporal sulcus (STSdp).   (B)   Mean activation

      the control group, patients with Sz had reduced mean activation in early visual
      [V1:   F  (1, 56) = 10.41,   p   = 0.002,   d   = 0.85] and motion-sensitive
      [MST:   F  (1, 56) = 4.10,   p   = 0.022,   d   = 0.76] parcels. ASD participants,
      in contrast, showed significantly higher activation of early visual regions
      [V2:   F  (1, 48) = 12.52,   p   = 0.001,   d   = 1.03] as well as reduced activity
      in prefrontal cortex [FEF:   F  (1, 48) = 4.24,   p   = 0.045,   d   = 0.59]
      relative to control subjects ( ). \n\nIn parallel with these divergent activation
      patterns, convergent deficits were observed in the pSTS parcels with reduced
      mean activation in both Sz [STSdp:   F  (1, 56) = 5.81,   p   = 0.019,   d   =
      0.97; TPOJ1:   F  (1, 56) = 11.83,   p   = 0.001,   d   = 0.93] and ASD [STSdp:   F  (1,
      48) = 4.48,   p   = 0.040,   d   = 0.86; TPOJ1:   F  (1, 48) = 9.43,   p   =
      0.004,   d   = 0.71] participants, compared to control subjects. Across subjects,
      activation of TPOJ1 was driven strongly by dynamic, relative to static, faces
      [  F  (1, 75) = 57.45,   p   < 0.001] ( ) with no main effect of emotion. In
      contrast, activation of STSdp was larger for both emotional (vs. neutral) [  F  (1,
      75) = 9.19,   p   = 0.003] and dynamic (vs. static) [  F  (1, 75) = 8.73,   p   =
      0.004] faces. Further, deficits in both clinical groups were differentially
      greatest in response to dynamic emotional faces [  F  (2, 75) = 5.28,   p   =
      0.025]. \n\n\n#### Amygdala \n  \nCompared to control subjects, overall activation
      of the amygdala (collapsed across face-motion and face-emotion) was significantly
      higher in Sz patients [  F  (1, 56) = 7.58,   p   = 0.008,   d   = 0.83]. Further,
      the interaction between group-membership and face-emotion was significant [  F  (1,
      56) = 4.93,   p   = 0.030] reflecting greater group differences for emotional,
      relative to neutral, faces [  F  (1, 56) = 4.93,   p   = 0.030] ( ). \n  \n

      superimposed on an MNI template volume.   (B)   Localization of the medial (pink;

      For each group, bar plots (top) are of beta values for emotional and neutral
      faces extracted from the whole pulvinar and (bottom) of mean betas from each
      subdivision. *  p   < 0.05; **  p   < 0.01; ***  p   < 0.001. \n  \nCompared
      to controls, activation of the amygdala was equivalent, overall, in ASD participants
      [  F  (1, 48) = 1.39,   p   = 0.244]. \n\n\n#### Pulvinar \n  \nRelative to
      controls, subcortical activation within PulN was reduced overall in Sz [  F  (1,
      56) = 4.35,   p   = 0.042,   d   = 0.44]. This reduction was relatively greater
      in response to emotional faces as indexed by the significant interaction between
      face-emotion and group membership [  F  (1, 56) = 4.96,   p   = 0.030,   d   =
      0.74] ( , top). \n\nIn contrast, mean activation of the PulN did not differ,
      overall, between ASD and control participants [  F  (1, 48) = 0.260,   p   =
      0.614]. \n\nThe PulN was segmented into its lateral (PL), inferior (PI) and
      medial (PM) subdivisions. Across subdivisions, mean activation differed overall
      as a function of group membership [  F  (2, 75) = 4.91,   p   = 0.009]. In PL
      [  F  (1, 56) = 9.97,   p   = 0.003,   d   = 0.82] and PM [  F  (1, 56) = 10.35,   p   =
      0.002,   d   = 0.84], activation was significantly reduced in Sz relative to
      controls. Neither PL [  F  (1, 48) = 0.068,   p   = 0.795] nor PM [  F  (1,
      48) = 0.127,   p   = 0.723] activation distinguished between ASD and control
      groups ( , bottom). A different pattern was observed in PI where activation
      was equivalent in Sz [  F  (1, 56) = 0.43,   p   = 0.513] compared to controls,
      but significantly enhanced in ASD [  F  (1, 48) = 6.42,   p   = 0.015,   d   =
      0.71], reflecting a disorder-specific, double-dissociation of subnucleus activation
      patterns in Sz vs. ASD. \n\n\n\n### Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Interrelationships
      \n  \nThe interrelationship between FER performance and cortical/subcortical
      activation patterns was assessed by ANCOVA. The results are summarized schematically
      in   (see also  ). \n  \n (A)   Interrelationship between activated cortical
      regions, pulvinar (PulN) activation and face-emotion recognition (FER) accuracy.
      Black lines denote a significant relationship across all groups. Orange lines
      denote significant relationship only in SZ group. Dashed green line denotes
      a significant (negative) correlation in ASD group only.   (B)   Correlation
      between FER accuracy and mean activation (beta) of the STSdp parcel. In all
      cases, black regression lines signify the correlation was significant across
      groups.   (C)   Correlation between STSdp-V1 and STSdp-TPOJ1 activation.   (D)   Correlation
      between STSdp-V2 activation. In ASD participants, enhanced V2 was associated
      with reduced STSdp activation. The opposite relationship was obtained in SZ
      and CTL groups.   (E)   Scatterplots showing a significant and positive correlation
      between PulN activation and TPOJ1 (left), STSdp (center) and MST (right) in
      the SZ group alone. \n  \nAn initial omnibus analysis tested FER simultaneously
      against mean activation in all nine fMRI regions identified in the between-group
      fMRI analyses (seven cortical parcels, amygdala, PulN) ( ). This model tested
      the null hypothesis that no regions significantly predicted FER performance
      beyond the effect of group membership. The model incorporating these covariates
      (Adj.   R   = 0.49) was statistically superior to a model incorporating group
      membership alone [Adj.   R   = 0.35;   F  (9, 68) = 3.42,   p   = 0.0002] (
      ) indicating that incorporation of these covariates significantly improved model
      fit. \n\nThe statistical contribution of the independent covariates was therefore
      considered in order to evaluate which regions contributed most to the overall
      model improvement. As expected, activation of the STSdp parcel most significantly
      predicted FER scores across participants [  F  (1, 66) = 16.61,   p   < 0.001].
      Moreover, a model incorporating only STSdp as a covariate showed a model fit
      (Adj.   R   = 0.51;  ) similar to that of the more complex model incorporating
      all covariates. In this simpler model, the relationship between STSdp and FER
      was highly significant [  F  (1, 74) = 26.24,   p   < 0.001]. In all groups,
      greater activation of STSdp correlated with improved behavioral performance
      (covaried by age and IQ) (Sz:   r   = 0.46,   p   = 0.018; ASD:   r   = 0.53,   p   =
      0.020; control:   r   = 0.41,   p   = 0.029) ( ). By contrast, no significant
      correlation was observed between FER and the other covariates in the analysis.
      \n\nThe relationship between the nine fMRI covariates was assessed in follow-up
      ANCOVAs run in stepwise fashion and including interactions with group membership
      in the model. As these were not independent tests of the overall null hypothesis,
      they were not considered to increase family-wise error regarding potential predictors
      of FER impairments across groups. Rather, the goal was to determine stepwise
      contributions to impaired STSdp activation, which was shown in the omnibus test
      to significantly predict FER across groups. \n\nMean activation of STSdp was
      predicted across groups by both V1 [  F  (1, 51) = 6.19,   p   = 0.016] and
      TPOJ1 [  F  (1, 51) = 6.77,   p   = 0.012] ( ). In turn, V1 was predicted by
      PulN activity [  F  (1, 54) = 8.80,   p   = 0.004], and TPOJ1 was predicted
      by MST [  F  (1, 57) = 18.29,   p   < 0.001], which also predicted FEF activation
      [  F  (1, 61) = 6.63,   p   = 0.012]. There were no further significant interrelationships
      across groups. \n\nAn interaction involving group membership, indicative of
      different slopes, was obtained between STSdp and V2 [  F  (2, 51) = 5.95,   p   =
      0.005] such that in ASD participants enhanced activation of V2 was associated
      with diminished STSdp activity (  r   = 0.71,   p   = 0.001) whereas in controls
      (  r   = 0.42,   p   = 0.023) and Sz (  r   = 0.44,   p   = 0.020) there was
      an inverse relationship ( ). \n\nLastly, group-specific interactions involving
      subcortical (PulN) activity were also obtained. Specifically, in Sz patients
      only, activation of STSdp [  F  (2, 51) = 4.51,   p   = 0.016], TPOJ1 [  F  (2,
      54) = 4.48,   p   = 0.016], and MST [  F  (2, 63) = 3.01,   p   = 0.047] were
      all significantly and positively associated with PulN activation ( ). \n\n\n###
      Mediation Analyses \n  \nA more detailed analysis of subcortical activation
      patterns in Sz was carried out with exploratory mediation analyses involving
      specific PulN subdivisions and interrelated cortical regions. Based on known
      anatomical interrelationships within the early visual system ( ) as well as
      the regression analyses described above, three specific predictor-outcome paths
      were evaluated (V1-STSdp, MST-TPJO1 and TPOJ1-STSdp) with PL, PM, or PI as potential
      mediators. The results are detailed in  . \n  \nResults of mediation analyses
      testing whether a proposed causal effect of X (predictor) on Y (outcome) may
      be transmitted through a mediating (M) variable. \n    \nConsistent with known
      anatomical projections of the lateral subdivision, activation of V1 significantly
      predicted mean PL activity (  p   = 0.001), which in turn predicted STSdp activation
      (  p   = 0.005) ( ). After controlling for PL activity, V1 was no longer associated
      with STSdp (  p   = 0.694), however, using a bootstrapping approach, the (unstandardized)
      coefficient for the indirect pathway from V1 to STSdp (V1  PL  STSdp) was significant
      (CI: [0.08, 0.84]), consistent with full mediation. \n  \n (A)   (Top) Correlations
      between PL and V1 activation (left Y-axis, solid circles) and between PL and
      STSdp activation (right Y-axis, open circles) in SZ patients. (Bottom) Schematic

      (a: V1-PL; b: PL-STSdp) and indirect (a*b) paths.   (B)   Correlations and TPOJ1  PM  STSdp
      mediated path.   (C)   Correlations and PI  MST  TPOJ1 path. \n  \nIn addition,
      a significant mediating effect of PM was observed between TPOJ1 and STSdp (TPOJ1  PM  STSdp;
      CI: [0.002, 1.13]) ( ) and of MST between PI and TPOJ1 (PI  MST  TPOJ1; CI:
      [0.13, 0.60]) ( ). In both cases, after controlling for the proposed mediator
      the direct paths between were not significant, suggesting full mediation. \n\n\n\n##
      Clinical Correlations \n  \nNo significant correlations were observed between
      behavioral FER performance or cortical/subcortical activation patterns and medication
      dose (CPZ equivalents) in Sz patients (  p   > 0.15 for all). Functional activation
      strengths did not correlate with measures of general cognitive ability (PSI
      and IQ) in any group (  p   > 0.11 for all), however, in Sz (  r   = 0.378,   p   =
      0.049) and control (  r   = 0.466,   p   = 0.044) participants, perceptual organization
      skill (POI) correlated with performance on the FER task as well as with STSdp
      activation (control:   r   = 0.539,   p   = 0.017; Sz:   r   = 0.399,   p   =
      0.035). \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nDeficits in social cognition contribute disproportionately
      to impaired functional outcome across a range of neurocognitive disorders, including
      Sz and ASD. FER is an important component of these deficits and, in the visual
      system, depends upon coordinated function of both subcortical and cortical regions
      for processing of static and dynamic facial features. Here, we investigated
      cortical and subcortical correlates of FER impairments in adults with Sz and
      ASD using a dynamic/static FER task that engages motion-sensitive areas as well
      as traditional face-processing regions. In addition, we investigated the subcortical
      pathway to cortex involving PulN. \n\nThe primary findings of the study relate
      to the relative involvement of cortico-cortical vs. thalamo-cortical transmission
      paths underlying impaired FER in Sz. Traditionally, it was assumed that cortical
      regions showing intercorrelated activity mediate their joint activations primarily
      through direct cortico-cortical connections ( ;  ). More recent models by contrast
      propose that connections are mediated primarily by successive loops between
      cortex and thalamus, with higher-tier thalamic regions such as PulN and dorsomedial
      nuclei generally interacting with posterior and anterior association regions,
      respectively ( ;  ). Within PulN, discrete subnuclei interact with specific
      visual cortical regions ( ). This theory converges with anatomical studies showing
      reduced PulN volume and cell number in schizophrenia ( ,  ;  ), along with our
      recent observations of impaired PulN activation to simple visual stimuli in
      Sz ( ,  ). \n\nIn the present study, activation deficits in Sz were observed
      within the HCP-MMP1.0 ( ) parcels comprising lower-tier visual regions including
      early visual and motion-sensitive cortex, along with higher-tier (multisensory)
      regions associated with FER. \n\nWithin STS two discrete parcels were activated
      by the task STSdp and TPOJ1. Activation of the STSdp, in particular, showed
      uniquely greater activation to dynamic emotional faces which correlated with
      behavioral measures of FER, in accord with the prominent role of STS in face-emotion
      assessment ( ). In Sz, STSdp deficits intercorrelated with impairments in activation
      of both early visual cortical regions and PulN. \n\n### Role of Pulvinar Subdivisions
      \n  \nPulN is divided into discrete anatomical subdivisions which mirror the
      dorsal/ventral stream distinction of visual cortex ( ) such that the more lateral
      regions (PL) project predominantly to primary visual cortex and ventral visual
      stream, whereas a subset of nuclei in the inferior subdivision (PI) project
      mainly to dorsal stream regions including motion-sensitive cortex (e.g., MST)
      ( ;  ;  ). The medial subdivision (PM) is primarily connected with multimodal
      sensory association areas as well as prefrontal and cingulate cortices and has
      been tied to emotion processing ( ). \n\nIn the present study, in addition to
      intercorrelated cortical activation deficits, we observed correlations between
      cortical regions and PulN subnuclei. We therefore conducted a series of mediation
      analyses to evaluate underlying pathways. \n\nAn initial analysis evaluated
      the potential pathways underlying intercorrelated deficits between V1 and STS
      in the schizophrenia group. A significant indirect pathway from V1PLSTSdp was
      observed, in support of indirect mediation by PL. Consistent with mediation
      by PM, the intercorrelation between the STS parcels (TPOJ1 and STSdp) was not
      significant once an indirect path   via   PM was modeled. \n\nIn contrast, PI
      appeared to mediate its effects   via   MST. Of note, unlike PL and PM, activation
      of PI was relatively intact in patients. Given that PI receives much of its
      driving inputs from neurons in the superior colliculus ( ), this finding is
      suggestive of unimpaired input   via   the retinotectal system. By contrast,
      the observed deficits in V1 are consistent with impaired input   via   the geniculostriate
      visual pathway ( ,  ). \n\nAlthough anatomical abnormalities in PulN are well-documented
      in schizophrenia ( ;  ), the functional consequences of these abnormalities
      have, to date, remained relatively unexplored. Here, we provide evidence that
      impairments in visual PulN function significantly undermines visual processing
      required for effective face processing. In specific, deficits in PL function
      may mediate effects of impaired V1 activation, which, in turn likely reflects
      impaired magnocellular input to cortex. In addition, impaired PM activation
      mediated impaired input from more posterior (TPOJ1) to mid-STS (STSdp) regions,
      suggesting that accumulating deficits across successive cortico-pulvinar loops
      may lead to the large effect-sized deficits in FER-related reduced STS activation
      in Sz. \n\n\n### Comparison to Autism Spectrum Disorders \n  \nWhile deficits
      in social cognition are a prominent component of Sz, they are not unique to
      the disorder. In particular, we ( ) and others ( ;  ) have reported FER deficits
      in adult ASD subjects that are as severe as those observed in Sz, despite the
      much higher level of overall function. Consistent with these prior results,
      adult ASD participants in the present study showed FER and STS activation deficits
      that were similar to those of Sz, supporting a role for STS as a common mediator
      of FER dysfunction across disorders. \n\nDespite the similar STS impairments,
      ASD participants showed markedly different patterns of disturbance within early
      visual regions. In contrast to Sz patients, markedly increased responses and
      an opposite slope of the relationship between V2 and STSdp activation were observed
      in the ASD group. Activation within other task-activated visual regions, including
      V1 and MST, was unaffected in ASD, echoing our recent study in which response
      amplitudes were also normal within V1, but increased in early visual and dorsal
      visual regions ( ). Similar visual hypo/hyper activation patterns in Sz vs.
      ASD have been observed in both fMRI (reviewed in  ;  ) and electrophysiological
      ( ,  ;  ;  ) studies, supporting the concept that dysregulation of the early
      visual system may undermine later stages of visual processing. \n\nPatterns
      of amygdalar and subcortical activation also distinguished between ASD and Sz
      participants. In the amygdala, activation was elevated overall in Sz (but not
      ASD), as reported previously (reviewed in  ), possibly reflecting abnormal salience
      attribution to neutral stimuli ( ;  ;  ), heightened anxiety ( ) and/or paranoid
      ideation ( ). \n\nIn contrast, whereas PulN activity was markedly reduced in
      Sz, activation of the inferior PulN subdivision was significantly elevated in
      ASD participants, in line with findings from our previous studies ( ,  ) and
      those of others ( ;  ;  ). Although the source of the increased activation in
      ASD is not known, a parsimonious explanation would be hyperactivity of the subcortical
      retino-collicular pathway, which provides preferential input to PI ( ) and which,
      in turn, acts like a driver to V2 ( ). In humans, this system typically weakens
      with age as the retinogeniculate system increases in functionality (reviewed
      in  ). Abnormal persistence of this system into adulthood could thus underlie
      the activation disturbance pattern observed in ASD. \n\nRegardless of underlying
      pathophysiology, these findings support the concept that dysregulation of the
      early visual system, whether in the direction of increased or decreased activation,
      may undermine later stages of visual processing and further highlight the importance
      of sensory processing abnormalities to the pathophysiology of social cognitive
      impairment across neuropsychiatric disorders. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nDespite
      our differential findings, some limitations must be considered. First, Sz participants
      were receiving antipsychotic medication which may have impacted measures on
      brain activity. We did not observe any correlations with medication dose, however,
      this issue could be best addressed in future studies involving medication-nave
      patients. Moreover, we note that the overall sample size remains small, and
      the findings need to be replicated in an independent sample. Additionally, we
      did not track fixation locations either in the scanner or during behavior. Thus,
      we do not know if activation failures relate to inability to process information,
      or simply from differential facial scanning approaches. Lastly, Sz participants
      had lower IQ and were older than controls or ASD participants, although correcting
      for IQ and age did not diminish the findings. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn
      summary, higher cortical (e.g., STS) contributions to impaired FER have been
      extensively documented in Sz and ASD ( ), but early visual and subcortical contributions
      have been evaluated to only a limited degree. Here, we demonstrate significant
      but opposite abnormalities of circuits centered on PulN in Sz vs. ASD that correlate
      with impaired STS activation, which in turn correlated across groups with impaired
      FER. These findings highlight the importance of close integration between subcortical
      and cortical visual processing pathways and the potential breakdown of this
      tight coordination in Sz and ASD. Further, the findings reaffirm that similar
      behavioral deficits (e.g., impairment in social cognition) do not necessarily
      imply convergent pathophysiological mechanisms, and that physiological measures
      may be useful for guiding etiological and interventional studies in neuropsychiatry.

      Method Based on Time-Series Fusion\n\n# Keywords\n\nfMRI template\nfused slices\ncustom\nsequences\n\n\n#
      Abstract\n \nAs the brain standard template for medical image registration has
      only been constructed with an MRI template, there is no three-dimensional fMRI
      standard template for use, and when the subjects brain structure is quite different
      from the standard brain structure, the registration to the standard space will
      lead to large errors. Registration to an individual space can avoid this problem.
      However, in the current fMRI registration algorithm based on individual space,
      the reference image is often selected by researchers or randomly selected fMRI
      images at a certain time point. This makes the quality of the reference image
      very dependent on the experience and ability of the researchers and has great
      contingency. Whether the reference image is appropriate and reasonable affects
      the rationality and accuracy of the registration results to a great extent.
      Therefore, a method for constructing a 3D custom fMRI template is proposed.
      First, the data are preprocessed; second, by taking a group of two-dimensional
      slices corresponding to the same layer of the brain in three-dimensional fMRI
      images at multiple time points as image sequences, each group of slice sequences
      are registered and fused; and finally, a group of fused slices corresponding
      to different layers of the brain are obtained. In the process of registration,
      in order to make full use of the correlation information between the sequence
      data, the feature points of each two slices of adjacent time points in the sequence
      are matched, and then according to the transformation relationship between the
      adjacent images, they are recursively forwarded and mapped to the same space.
      Then, the fused slices are stacked in order to form a three-dimensional customized
      fMRI template with individual pertinence. Finally, in the classic registration
      algorithm, the difference in the registration accuracy between using a custom
      fMRI template and different standard spaces is compared, which proves that using
      a custom template can improve the registration effect to a certain extent. \n
      \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nIn medical image registration, the two
      images involved in the registration are called the reference image and floating
      image, respectively [ , , ]. Among them, the reference image will not change
      before and after registration. After registration, each meaningful anatomical
      point on the floating image will correspond to the corresponding anatomical
      point of the reference image one by one. Medical image registration is to find
      the corresponding optimal spatial transformation to make the anatomical points
      in the floating image consistent with the spatial position of the anatomical
      points in the reference image. The result of medical image registration should
      make the anatomical points of the two images, or at least all the points with
      diagnostic significance, match correspondingly [ , , ]. \n\nThe current brain
      image registration algorithm based on deep learning focuses on how to achieve
      spatial structure consistency between the image to be registered and the reference
      image of the same mode through transformation, which is more reasonable for
      the images to be registered from different subjects with high spatial resolution,
      such as MRI, which can be registered to the publicly available standard brain
      template for comparison, However, there is no standard template in the fMRI
      mode. In addition, for subjects whose brain structures are quite different from
      the standard template, such as the elderly and children, there will be a large
      error in registration to the standard space, and registration to the individual
      space can avoid this problem [ ]. However, the individual template currently
      used is usually the fMRI image at a certain point in time selected by experts
      or researchers, which is highly accidental and depends heavily on the experience
      of researchers, which is not very reasonable. \n\nAs the brain standard template
      for medical image registration has been built only with an MRI template, there
      is no three-dimensional fMRI standard template to use, and when the brain structure
      of the subjects is quite different from the standard brain structure, registration
      to the standard space will lead to large errors, and registration to the individual
      space can avoid this problem. \n\nFor different subjects, there are often huge
      differences in the brain structures among the different individuals, and the
      spatial positions of corresponding points are obviously different. If not aligned,
      it is often impossible to carry out subsequent research and an analysis, such
      as determining the location of the focus by comparing the brain structure of
      patients with a disease with that of healthy controls [ , , ]. Even for the
      same subject, due to the time interval of the image acquisition, different viewing
      angles, and different equipment, the corresponding points between the images
      will be different, such as the changes in the region of interest on the image
      before and after the time interval in the process of functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) image scanning [ ]. The emergence of medical image registration
      can well solve the above problems, effectively reduce the influence of position
      change during multiple imaging, and even correct the differences caused by the
      imaging mode itself [ ]. \n\nAt present, fMRI image registration algorithms
      can be divided into standard space-based registration and individual space-based
      registration [ ]. Registration based on standard space is usually used for image
      registration among different subjects, and there is no published standard fMRI
      template at present [ ], so most of them need to introduce the MRI standard
      template. However, it has great limitations for subjects with great differences
      in brain shape and structure from a standard brain, such as children and the
      elderly. Registration based on individual space effectively avoids this problem
      and is more suitable for fMRI data that usually help determine active brain
      areas by comparing the differences between the sequence data of the same subject.
      However, in the current registration methods based on individual space, most
      of the reference templates are randomly selected from data sequences, selected
      by researchers according to experience, or directly selected from the first
      effective time-point data, which leads to such methods being too dependent on
      researchers and having strong randomness [ ]. Therefore, the registration of
      fMRI data needs a reasonable fMRI template based on individual space as a reference
      image for intra-individual registration. \n\nBecause fMRI can obtain four-dimensional
      data by scanning the brain many times in a time period, that is, a sequence
      composed of three-dimensional fMRI images at multiple time points, in which
      each three-dimensional fMRI image contains multiple two-dimensional slices corresponding
      to different layers of the brain, fMRI sequences often show the characteristics
      in large numbers and timing. Because fMRI speculates on the functional state
      of the brain by observing the active areas of the brain over a period of time,
      it is of great significance to change the position of features in images at
      different time points [ ]. In order to keep as much information as possible
      in the registration of the 3D fMRI image sequences at different time points,
      it is necessary that the reference images used in the registration process contain
      more effective sequence information, so the template is constructed by using
      all effective fMRI data sequences at different time points. \n\nAs a group of
      fMRI image sequences generated by scanning the same position in a certain period
      of time by the functional nuclear magnetic resonance instrument, it often shows
      the characteristics in a large number, the orderly image itself, and the large
      correlation between two adjacent sequence images. The characteristics can indirectly
      reflect the movement trend of the object in the positions of different sequence
      images and have certain significance. The data at different time points have
      a certain correlation and do not exist independently. If we want to register
      a batch of fMRI images to a template, the more relevant feature information
      between the batch of images to be registered, the better. In order to make full
      use of the effective information between the fMRI sequences of the data to be
      registered, in the process of constructing the fMRI template, the transformation
      model is obtained by matching the two feature points of the two adjacent images
      based on the method of feature points. Then, by considering the relationship
      between the sequence data, the whole image is mapped to the reference image,
      so as to retain the effective information, such as the correlation between all
      the data, to the greatest extent, Finally, the matching results are fused to
      construct a custom fMRI template. \n\nTherefore, a method for constructing a
      3D custom fMRI template is proposed. First, the data are preprocessed. Second,
      by taking a group of two-dimensional slices corresponding to the same layer
      of the brain in three-dimensional fMRI images at multiple time points as image
      sequences, each group of slice sequences are registered and fused. Third, a
      group of fused slices corresponding to different layers of the brain are obtained.
      In the process of registration, in order to make full use of the correlation
      information between the sequence data, the feature points of each two slices
      of adjacent time points in the sequence are matched. Fourth, according to the
      transformation relationship between adjacent images, they are recursively forwarded
      and mapped to the same space. Finally, the fused slices are stacked in order
      to form a three-dimensional customized fMRI template with individual pertinence.
      \n\nThe contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows. \n  \nA custom
      3D fMRI template construction method based on time-series fusion is proposed
      to retain the correlation information in the time series to the greatest extent.
      \n  \nThe reference image is constructed to effectively improve the registration
      effect of the existing registration algorithm. \n  \nFinally, the effectiveness
      of the proposed method is tested on a large number of real datasets. \n  \nThe
      rest of paper is structured as follows.   introduces the custom template construction
      process. In  , three groups of experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness
      of the proposed method. The purpose and results of the study are discussed in  .   summarizes
      the methods and effects. \n\n\n## 2. Method \n  \nReferring to the method for
      constructing human brain template for fMRI, it can be seen that the construction
      process of human brain template usually includes three parts: image preprocessing,
      image registration, and image fusion. Therefore, the process of building a custom
      fMRI template in this chapter is shown in  . \n\nFirstly, the fMRI dataset images
      are collected and preprocessed. The preprocessing steps include time layer correction
      and head movement correction. Time layer correction is used to correct the difference
      of acquisition time points between the middle layer and the layer in each three-dimensional
      brain process. Head movement correction is used to reduce noise interference.
      The preprocessed fMRI data can be regarded as multiple aligned three-dimensional
      brains. Secondly, for the registration and fusion of multiple groups of slices
      on the same layer in each three-dimensional fMRI image, the image registration
      method based on feature points is adopted. In the registration process, in order
      to make full use of the effective information between sequence data, the transformation
      model is obtained by matching two feature points of adjacent time-point slices,
      so as to retain the effective information between adjacent data as much as possible,
      and then by considering the relationship between sequence data, all effective
      slices are mapped to the same space by recursion. Next, the same layer slices
      of each group were fused to obtain a group of fused slices corresponding to
      different layers of the brain. Finally, the fused slices were stacked into three-dimensional
      custom fMRI templates in order. \n\n### 2.1. fMRI SequenceFeature Point Mapping
      Relationship Model \n  \nThe registration method based on image feature points
      has the advantages of small amount of data, stability, and easy extraction.
      It can effectively and quickly process fMRI image sequences with large amount
      of data. Therefore, the image registration method based on feature points will
      be used to register fMRI image sequence data. \n\n#### 2.1.1. Feature Point
      Extraction \n  \nFeature point extraction is the extraction and abstraction
      of the effective content in the image. It is the first link of image registration
      using feature points. Extracting stable, effective, and robust feature points
      is very important for image registration. Poor feature points or feature points
      extracted by noise interference will affect the determination of geometrictransformation
      relationship in subsequent registration. The feature points of fMRI slice images
      are extracted by SIFT method [ ]. Sift method establishes multiple different
      scale spaces, obtains the key information such as the position and scale of
      feature points, and describes the point on the vector through these features,
      so as to achieve the purpose of extracting feature points. The process of extracting
      feature points using SIFT includes: constructing scale space, key point extraction,
      direction allocation, feature point description, and matching. \n\n Constructing
      scale space  : Convolving the original image with a two-dimensional Gaussian
      function at different scales can generate multiscale Gaussian space, the mathematical
      formula is expressed as follows.\n  represents multiscale Gaussian space.   represents
      Gaussian kernel function,   represents image matrix.  represents convolution
      operator,   represents scale-space factor. \n\nFirst, we downsample the image
      and Gaussian blur at different scales, establish multiple sets of multi-scale-space
      sequences to form the image Gaussian pyramid. Then, subtract adjacent images
      in each set of scale-space sequences, forming a difference of Gaussian pyramid
      (DOG) [ ]. \n\nThe mathematical expression is as follows.\n \nwhich leads to:
      \n\n shows an example of a Gaussian pyramid.   shows an example of the differential
      Gaussian pyramid. Although the image looks generally composed of black areas
      and can only see the subtle outline, it contains a lot of key information. \n\n
      Key point extraction  : Key point is the local extreme point of DOG. To form
      a local three-dimensional space, we compare the pixel at the core position with
      8 same surrounding scale neighboring points and   different scale points with
      upper and lower neighboring points. Then, set the maximum or minimum point in
      each local stereo space as key point, fit the scale-space DOG function with
      a three-dimensional quadratic function in scale space, remove key points with
      poor stability.\n \n\n and obtain the offset of extreme points as follows.\n
      \n\n represents the offset from the interpolation center. When the offset in
      any dimension is greater than  , it means that the interpolation center has
      shifted, change the current key point position and interpolate at the new position
      to convergence. Then, obtain the precise location and scale information of feature
      points, find the principal curvature through Hessian matrix to eliminate unstable
      edge response points. The specific formula is as follows.\n \n\nThe eigenvalues   and   of
      the   H   represent the gradients in the   x   and   y   directions.   represents
      the sum of the diagonal elements of matrix   H  .   represents the determinant
      of matrix   H  . Assume   is the larger eigenvalue, and assume   is the smaller
      eigenvalue, let  , stable feature points will satisfy formula below.\n \n\nKeep
      the feature points that meet the above formula, otherwise eliminate them to
      complete the extraction of key points. The key point extraction results of fMRI
      slices at two different time points are shown in  . It can be observed that
      there are both the same key points, which can be matched as features, and different
      key points in the two images, which need further correction. \n\n Key points
      direction assignment  : In Gaussian pyramid image, we calculate the gradient
      modulus and direction of all pixels in a circular area with a radius of   around
      each key point, use this as a reference to assign a reference direction for
      each key point. The magnitude and direction of the gradient are calculated,
      respectively. Using formula: \n\n represents the gradient direction angle of
      the feature point  ,   represents the gradient modulus of the feature point  ,   is
      the pixel value of the feature point   in the Gaussian pyramid. Set feature
      point as the center, rotate feature points within its neighborhood, keep the
      main direction at zero degrees. Then, use the gradient histogram to count the
      above information, divide the gradient direction into 36 columns, each column
      is divided by a span of 10 angles as abscissa, gradient magnitude as ordinate.
      Take the largest gradient amplitude as the main direction of feature points.
      \n\n\n#### 2.1.2. Feature Point Description \n  \nTo perform feature matching,
      a feature vector needs to be defined as the feature descriptor of each feature
      point as a unique label for each feature point. The feature vector can be regarded
      as an abstraction of the feature point and the information in the area is unique.
      Gradient location and orientation histogram (GLOH) [ ] is used as a feature
      descriptor, as shown in  . We chose to use GLOH descriptors for the following
      reasons: Compared with PCA-SIFT and standard SIFT descriptors, it has better
      results on both edge features and smooth image processing. Secondly, compared
      with Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) [ ], GLOH has a better processing result
      on blurred images. GLOH descriptor is robust and unique which reduces dependence
      on sample images. GLOH descriptors use a logarithmic polar hierarchy to replace
      the 4-quadrant traditional descriptor. Take a radius of 6, 11, 15 in space,
      and divide it into 8 intervals in angle (except for the middle area), and obtain
      136 ( )-dimensional vector as the final feature vector. \n\n\n#### 2.1.3. Feature
      Point Matching \n  \nMatch every feature point of the reference image and every
      feature point of the image to be matched one-to-one. Calculate the Euclidean
      distance between the feature vectors corresponding to each pair of feature points,
      use this to determine the correspondence between them. The closer the Euclidean
      distance between two point feature vectors, the greater the chance of successful
      matching. The formula for calculating the Euclidean distance in n-dimensional
      space is as follows.\n \n\nThe specific method of feature point matching is
      as follows. First, select the feature point   B   in the image to be matched.
      Calculate the Euclidean distance between   b   and each feature point of the
      reference image and find the feature point with the smallest distance  . Then,
      find the nearest feature point   C   and the second nearest point   D   to point   in
      the reference image. Calculate the ratio of the distance between points   B   and   C   to
      the distance between points   C   and   D   to obtain the correct matching point.
      The specific formula is as follows.\n \n\nThe practical application in fMRI
      data is shown in  . By comparing the number of matching successful feature points
      under different thresholds, this paper selects 0.9 as the given threshold. \n\nWhen
      the ratio is less than the given threshold ( ), the match succeeded; otherwise,
      it failed. An example of the feature point matching effect is shown in  . \n\n\n####
      2.1.4. Mapping Model Evaluation and Image Sequence Matching \n  \nThrough the
      above steps, the feature matching is realized, and the feature points matching
      each other in the two images are obtained. Then, this paper selects random sample
      consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to evaluate the mapping model and calculates the
      geometrictransformation relationship between the image to be registered and
      the reference image, according to the matching results. The transformation relationship
      between adjacent frames is obtained in two steps. \n\nThe specific implementation
      steps are as follows:   \nRandomly extract four sample data from the feature
      point matching set M (the four samples cannot be collinear), calculate the transformation
      matrix, and record it as Model T; \n  \nCalculate the projection error between
      all data in the feature point matching set M and Model T. If the error is less
      than the threshold TR, it will be added to the successfully matched feature
      point set G; \n  \nIf the number of elements of the current successfully matched
      feature point set G is greater than the optimal matched feature point set  ,
      then update  , and the number of iterations K is updated at the same time; \n  \nIf
      the number of iterations exceeds the upper limit or the number of successfully
      matched feature points exceeds the critical value, exit the iteration; otherwise,
      the number of iterations is increased by 1, and steps 13 are repeated; \n  \nOutput
      the final transformation model T. \n  \n\nSet B is a set of matching point pairs
      that comply with epipolar constraints. The more elements in set B, the more
      accurate the estimation of the transformation model. RANSAC algorithm is to
      randomly select the matching items and ensure the transformation model with
      the largest number of elements in set B as the best result through iteration.
      The feature points that can adapt to the model results are called local points,
      and the feature points that do not adapt to the optimal model results are called
      external points. These external points may come from wrong measurement methods,
      wrong assumptions, wrong calculations, or extreme values of noise. In the process
      of iteration, the iteration round K is constantly updated rather than fixed
      when the number of iterations does not reach the limit value. The specific calculation
      method is as follows: \nwhere   p   represents the probability that the points
      randomly selected from the dataset are all local points in some iterative processes.
      \n\nAt this time, the model is likely to be useful, so   p   can also represent
      the probability that the results obtained by the algorithm are useful. As a
      confidence degree, it is usually taken as 0.995;   m   is the minimum number
      of samples required for the calculation model, which is 4 in this experiment;   w   represents
      the probability of selecting one local point from the dataset each time, as
      shown in the following formula: \nwhere   f   represents the number of local
      points and   n   represents the number of feature points of the dataset. \n\nIn
      the process of overall registration of fMRI image sequence, all images need
      to be mapped to the coordinate system of the same reference image. However,
      if each frame image is directly registered to the reference image, the correlation
      information between the front and rear adjacent frame images in the image sequence
      will be lost, which is quite fatal to the function-based sequence data of fMRI.
      \n\nAccording to the comparison between the feature point matching similarity
      between the sequence image to be registered and the fixed reference image in   and   and
      the feature point matching similarity between adjacent frame images (only part
      is shown), it can be seen that the feature point matching similarity between
      adjacent frame images is generally higher than that of all images registered
      to the reference image at the first time point (after removing the data of the
      first n time points). This is also in line with the theory that there is a certain
      correlation between adjacent frame data, so the global registration of every
      two adjacent frame images is given priority. Firstly, starting from the transformation
      relationship between a pair of adjacent images, the relationship between each
      frame image and the previous image is recursively deduced. After the adjacent
      recursion is completed, the matching relationship between each image and the
      first time-point image is obtained according to the corresponding recursion
      relationship. It is assumed that   is the matrix representation of the matching
      relationship between the relevant images between the   frame image and the   frame
      image. The specific relationship representation is as follows: \n\n\n\n### 2.2.
      Construction of Custom Template Based on Sequence Fusion \n  \nNext, each set
      of slices in the same layer after registration is regarded as a sequence, and
      the sequence is fused. According to the level of fusion process, image fusion
      algorithm can be divided into signal-level fusion, pixel-level fusion, feature-level
      fusion, and decision-level fusion. Among them, the signal-level image fusion
      fuses the unprocessed signal in the signal domain, and the fused signal is a
      random variable mixed with different correlation noise. This method can be regarded
      as a rough estimation of image fusion and cannot realize image fusion accurately.
      Feature-level image fusion extracts the feature information contained in the
      source image as the region of interest or target. However, because the feature
      information needs to be analyzed, processed, and integrated in the fusion process,
      many details are often lost. Decision-level image fusion is more targeted and
      less computational than the first two methods, but it is too dependent on the
      previous level, resulting in the blurred image. In contrast, pixel-level image
      fusion can retain as much information as possible in the source image. After
      fusion, the image has increased both in content and detail and is superior to
      other methods in accuracy and robustness. Therefore, pixel-level image fusion
      method is the most widely used in the field of medical images, and it is also
      a research hotspot in this field. \n\nIn the pixel-level fusion of the image,
      the direct average method is the simplest. It can directly sum and average the
      pixel values of the overlapping area, so as to avoid the problem that the overflow
      may lead to the failure of the normal representation of the image. Let   be
      the fused image of   and  , then the calculation expression of the direct average
      method is: \n\nAlthough the direct average method can perform simple and fast
      operations, the quality of the fused image is relatively poor because the direct
      average algorithm will weaken the contrast of the image, especially when the
      effective signal only exists in one image. \n\nTherefore, the weighted average
      method is used to improve the direct average method, by weighting the two source
      images, rather than simply adding and summing to obtain the average. Let   be
      the image generated after the fusion of   and  , and the calculation formula
      of the weighted average method is: \n\nIn the above formula,  ,   are the weights
      corresponding to the pixel gray values of images   and   in the calculation
      process, and  ,   and  , the gradual-in and gradual-out method is generally
      adopted   and  . Determine two weights: \nwhere   and   are the left and right
      boundary coordinates of the part to be fused, respectively, Xi is the abscissa
      of the pixel to be fused,  . The weighted average method with added weight avoids
      the defects of the direct average method, and the operation is relatively simple,
      and the processing speed is very fast, so it is also widely used. \n\nIn addition,
      pixel-level fusion methods based on multi-scale transform, such as image fusion
      based on pyramid transform and image fusion based on wavelet transform, although
      they have their own uniqueness, the operation is more complex and takes longer
      time, which does not meet the short-term requirements of building a user-defined
      template for the subjects in this experiment, so they are not adopted. After
      the weighted average method is adopted to complete the sequence image fusion,
      a group of fused slices corresponding to the number of brain layers are obtained,
      and these slices are stacked in order to construct a three-dimensional custom
      fMRI reference template. \n\nThe custom template finally constructed in this
      paper retains as much information as possible in the sequence image, and the
      original size of fMRI sequence data is  , where   w   and   h  , respectively,
      represent the length and width of the scanned brain,   s   represents the number
      of layers of the brain scanned from top to bottom, and   t   represents the
      number of scans of the complete brain during the experiment. After preprocessing,
      the size is   four-dimensional fMRI sequence (the first   n   unstable time-point
      data are removed in the preprocessing process) converted into   three-dimensional
      fMRI sequences with the size of   NII format file, and then put each in 3D.
      The NII file is sliced into   q   two-dimensional files with the size of   w  ,
      according to the   z  -axis. The DICOM format image of   h   saves the DICOM
      metadata of all slices regarded as the reference image at the first time point.
      Then, add a total of   DICOM data converted into PNG format, and   slices belonging
      to the same layer of the brain are matched and fused to form a set of two-dimensional
      slice images with the number of   s  . Then, dicom-concert software is used
      to convert the s PNG format slices into DICOM format, and the DICOM metadata
      of some important reference images, such as subject number and age, are embedded.
      Then, it will be stacked in three dimensions of NII format to become a user-defined
      reference template. \n\n\n\n## 3. Experiments \n  \n### 3.1. Data \n  \nThe
      data used in this article come from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)
      project [ ]. This project aims to accelerate the understanding of the deep brain
      mechanism of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which integrates the brain structure
      and functional imaging data from many laboratories around the world. The abide
      I and abide II datasets were used. The abide I data were collected from 17 centers,
      including 1112 subjects, including 539 ASD patients and 573 normal controls;
      the abide II dataset was collected from 19 centers, including 1114 subjects,
      including 521 ASD patients and 593 normal controls. \n\nTo construct a 3D custom
      fMRI template using fMRI time-series data, we first need to preprocess the data.
      The basic idea of fMRI data preprocessing is to eliminate the timing error of
      the interlayer scanning and the head movement error caused by the subjects head
      movement in the scanning process, and then carry out the time-layer correction
      and head movement correction for the fMRI functional image. Because the custom
      template constructed for the subjects is eager to retain the individual specificity
      of the subjects, it does not need to be standardized. Therefore, the steps of
      the MRI structural image and the fMRI functional image registration and applying
      the corresponding MRI registration parameters to the fMRI functional images
      after the timing and head movement correction do not need to be introduced in
      the preprocessing process, and the data do not need to be smoothed. Therefore,
      this chapter only uses the time-horizon correction and head movement correction
      to process the data. \n\nThe SPM12 plug-in in the MATLAB 2020A environment is
      used for the data preprocessing in this experiment. The fMRI sequence registration
      algorithm based on the feature point extraction and the template construction
      algorithm based on image fusion can be applied to the template construction
      task of various single-subject medical image sequences. The relevant experimental
      environment is shown in  . \n\n\n### 3.2. Experiment Results \n  \nTaking an
      8-year-old girl with autism, numbered 50,795 in the Autism Brain Imaging Data
      Exchange (ABIDE) dataset, as an example, this paper analyzes the custom template
      in the form of slices. The fMRI data size of the subject is  . After discarding
      the data images of the first four time points and eliminating the invalid data
      whose head movement exceeds the limit at two time points, the final effective
      data are  , and the size of the final built custom template is  , as shown in  .
      \n\nThe custom template has individual pertinence, that is, it is constructed
      by using the subjects fMRI sequence. Therefore, the constructed custom template
      is related to the subjects age and brain structure, and the subjects are different
      from each other.   shows the fMRI data of four example subjects with autism
      at five different time points and the custom built template in which sub50795
      is an 8-year-old girl, sub50625 is a 7-year-old boy, sub51581 is a 64-year-old
      man, and sub50526 is a 50-year-old man. According to the sagittal diagram of
      the fMRI data of the four subjects, it can be found that there are very obvious
      differences in the brain structure, size, and development between the children
      and the adults. The user-defined fMRI template constructed for each subject
      retains the information contained in the images at different time points in
      the sequence data of the subjects to the greatest extent, especially for sub51581
      and sub50526 of the two adults. Therefore, in the registration based on a single
      subject, it is more appropriate and reasonable to register the fMRI sequence
      data to the user-defined fMRI template than to randomly select the data at a
      certain time point as the reference image. \n\nIn order to verify the accuracy
      and rationality of the custom fMRI template, this paper uses several classical
      registration algorithms to evaluate the accuracy of the custom fMRI template.
      Under the two conditions of using the randomly selected time-point image as
      the reference image (in this experiment, the image of the first effective time
      point is directly used as the randomly selected time point) and using the user-defined
      fMRI template as the reference image, the registration accuracy of the fMRI
      sequence registration of the same subject is compared. In the experiment, the
      measurement value between the two images after the registration is calculated.
      And then, the average value is taken for display. Because both the image to
      be registered and the reference image are fMRI modes, the registration effect
      is evaluated by using the Mean Square Error (MSE), Advanced Normalized Correlation
      (NCC), Advanced Mattes Mutual Information (MI), and Normalized Mutual Information
      (NMI), commonly used to evaluate a single-mode registration. The matching criteria
      are to find the maximum correlation between the template and each subgraph,
      that is, the registered image. All the valid time-point data of 1114 subjects
      were registered with templates, and the average value of the evaluation indexes
      was displayed. \n\nThe smaller the mean square error (MSE), the better the registration
      effect. It can be observed from   that the self-defined fMRI template is used
      as the reference template for registration on the Affine, SyN of ANTs [ ], and
      VoxelMorph registration algorithms based on deep learning [ ]. The registration
      accuracy has been improved to varying degrees compared with using the randomly
      selected image at a certain   fMRI volume (the first effective time point is
      directly used in this experiment) as the reference template for registration.
      \n\nThe registration based on a standard MRI structural image is the traditional
      method of fMRI registration. Because the spatial resolution of a fMRI image
      is relatively low, it is often difficult to define the similarity or difference
      between images intuitively, and when collecting fMRI data, the MRI structure
      image of the subject can usually be obtained at the same time, which has a high
      spatial resolution and richer structural details. Therefore, fMRI is registered
      with the help of an MRI image. \n\nMost of the standard MRI structural images
      used in this process are selected from the standard human brain template database,
      mainly including the Talairach standard template [ ], MNI305 standard template,
      ICBM152 template, and Colin27 template [ ]. Among them, the Talairach standard
      template is corresponding to the Talairach standard space [ ]; other brain templates
      correspond to the MNI standard space [ ]. At present, the most commonly used
      standard MRI brain template is the MNI305 standard template, which is based
      on the brain structure of 305 adult subjects with an average age of 23.4 years.
      Here, the registration errors under the above standard templates are compared
      according to the Voxelmorph algorithm, as shown in  . In the comparison experiment
      between the self-defined reference template construction algorithm for the fMRI
      sequence and the standard space method, which reduces noise interference, the
      correlation between the sequence images is preserved to the greatest extent.
      At the same time, the individual pertinence is retained, which effectively avoids
      the error caused by the large difference in shape and size when using the standard
      template to match the brains of patients, such as children and the elderly,
      and eliminates the contingency caused by the existing individual-based registration
      algorithm using randomly selected images at any time point as reference templates.
      The results show that the effect of a custom template is better than that of
      a standard template. \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nAt present, brain image
      registration algorithms focus on how to make the image to be registered consistent
      with the reference image in spatial structure through transformation. This is
      reasonable for images with high spatial resolution, such as MRI, from different
      subjects, which can be registered to publicly available standard brain templates
      for comparison, but there is no standard template with the fMRI mode at present.
      In addition, for the elderly, children, and other subjects whose brain structure
      is quite different from the standard template, there will be a big error in
      registration to the standard space, but registration to the individual space
      can avoid this problem. However, the individual template used at present is
      usually fMRI images selected by experts or researchers at a certain time point,
      which is accidental and depends on the experience of researchers, so it is not
      very reasonable. \n\nOnly an MRI template has been constructed for medical image
      registration, and there is no three-dimensional fMRI standard template available.
      When the brain structure of the subject is quite different from the standard
      brain structure, registration to the standard space will lead to large errors,
      but registration to the individual space can avoid this problem. However, in
      the current fMRI registration algorithm based on individual space, the reference
      image is often selected by researchers or randomly selected fMRI images at a
      certain time point, which makes the quality of the reference image depend on
      the experience and ability of researchers and has great contingency. \n\nFrom
      the perspective of brain imaging, the imaging results of MRI and fMRI belong
      to two types of brain imaging, namely structural brain imaging and functional
      brain imaging. MRI is structural imaging, usually used in the study of the brain
      structure, such as for the diagnosis of brain tumors. MRI data are three-dimensional
      images. It can be regarded as infinite-time resolution, often with extremely
      high spatial resolution, and can provide abundant structural detailed information.
      In MRI brain imaging, we can distinguish the morphological structure of gray
      matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid and also see the tiny details
      of various structures, such as anatomical boundaries, so as to judge whether
      there are lesions or injuries. fMRI data are a four-dimensional fMRI sequence
      with time dimension. As functional brain imaging, it is usually used to study
      cognitive and emotional processes. Imaging is obtained by scanning the brain
      several times over a period of time. fMRI specializes in studying blood flow
      in the brain and has very high time resolution, which is equivalent to the real-time
      log of the brain and is four-dimensional data containing time-dimension information.
      \n\nBecause of the inherent weakness of the MRI technology, the corresponding
      cost of high temporal resolution is the reduction in spatial resolution, so
      fMRI images cannot clearly observe the anatomical structure of the brain, so
      it is difficult to directly define the differences between the images. \n\nAccording
      to the information contained in the image, the concept of fMRI-oriented medical
      image registration can be divided into two categories: function-based and structure-based.
      Among them, in the function-based fMRI image registration method, the registration
      based on the function signal needs to ensure the synchronization and consistency
      of different individual function signals, and many data are difficult to meet
      the requirements. The fMRI image registration method based on the global functional
      connection mode is based on the principle that the functional signals in the
      same fMRI data must be synchronized, consistent, and comparable. The whole brainfunctional
      connection matrix is used to describe the functional information, but when some
      pixels in the matrix are disturbed by space, all points in the matrix will be
      affected, which leads to the lack of robustness of this method. \n\nBecause
      the function-based fMRI image registration methods require extremely high data
      and have strong application limitations, most of the existing fMRI image registration
      methods are structure-based. In this paper, fMRI registration is also based
      on structure, and the structure-based image registration is to align the floating
      image with the reference image in the anatomical structure. In order to ensure
      that the anatomical structures corresponding to the same voxel positions of
      two images are consistent, the structure-based registration first needs to map
      two images into the same space and use a common reference coordinate. There
      are two reference coordinate systems in the field of fMRI registration, which
      are standard space based on a large number of subjects and individual space
      based on a single subject. \n\nfMRI registration based on standard space is
      to register the anatomical points of the brain images of subjects into the standard
      space constructed according to a large number of subjects. At present, the most
      common standard space is the MNI standard space. This method can be used for
      inter-individual registration or intra-individual registration. The images to
      be registered are registered into the standard space, and the standard human
      brain template is selected as the reference image, and then the differences
      between the images to be registered are determined by comparative analysis.
      There are two main methods for fMRI registration based on the standard space
      of a large number of subjects: registration based on standard MRI structural
      images and registration based on reference standard fMRI templates. \n\nRegistration
      based on standard MRI structural images is the traditional method of fMRI registration.
      Because the spatial resolution of fMRI images is relatively low, it is often
      difficult to define the similarity or difference between images intuitively.
      When collecting fMRI data, the MRI structural images of the subjects can usually
      be obtained at the same time, which has high spatial resolution and richer structural
      details. Therefore, fMRI registration is carried out by using MRI images. However,
      fMRI measures blood flow signals, while MRI measures tissue structure, which
      are of different orders of magnitude and cannot be directly compared. Moreover,
      due to the influence of noise and other factors, they may have different shapes.
      The advantage of this method is that it uses MRI images with high spatial resolution
      to estimate the deformation in standard space, but this method assumes that
      affine transformation can correct any difference between fMRI and MRI images
      of the same subject and does not take into account the influence of geometric
      distortion on fMRI data. \n\nMost of the standard MRI structural images used
      in this process are selected from the standard human brain template database,
      mainly including the Talairach standard template, MNI305 standard template,
      ICBM152 template, and Colin 27 template. Among them, except that the standard
      space corresponding to the Talairach standard template is the Talairach standard
      space, other brain templates all correspond to the MNI standard space. At present,
      the most widely used standard MRI human brain template is the MNI305 standard
      template, which is constructed from the brains of 305 adult subjects with an
      average age of 23.4 years. \n\nThe registration of the reference standard fMRI
      template is to directly register the fMRI image to be registered with the selected
      three-dimensional standard fMRI template with low spatial resolution, which
      is the main problem solved by the single-mode registration based on depth learning
      at present. This method does not need MRI structural images, but because of
      the lack of adjustment of image details according to the MRI images, the registration
      results obtained are worse than the traditional two-step registration based
      on structural images, and there is no standard 3D fMRI template available publicly
      at present. \n\nBrain image registration based on standard space selects the
      constructed standard space as the reference coordinate system. However, fMRI
      data are often used for the early diagnosis and treatment of mental diseases
      and many functional brain diseases, such as autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimers
      disease. Their onset period is often childhood or old age. As shown in   and  ,
      it can be found that the brains of such subjects are often quite different from
      the MRI standard general template made according to adult brains in size and
      brain structure, and the method of registering them into the standard space
      may cause large errors, which limits the application of this method to a certain
      extent. \n\nIn the analysis of a single-subject data sample, the above situation
      can be effectively avoided. Instead of normalizing the data into the standard
      space, the fMRI registration method based on the subjects individual space is
      adopted, and the individual-specific fMRI template is used as the reference
      image. This method directly registers the image to be registered with the selected
      reference image, which is usually randomly selected by researchers from the
      image sequence, choosing a relatively standard fMRI image with a relatively
      standard shape and structure or choosing the fMRI image corresponding to the
      first effective time point as the reference image. The advantage of this method
      is that it retains the individual specificity of the reference image, which
      makes the registration based on a single subject more accurate. However, due
      to the randomness of the reference image selection or the dependence on the
      ability and experience of researchers, the method has great contingency. \n\nA
      self-defined reference template construction algorithm for an fMRI sequence
      is proposed. The noise interference is reduced, the correlation between the
      sequence images is preserved to the greatest extent, and at the same time, the
      individual pertinence is retained, which effectively avoids the error caused
      by the large difference in shape and size when using the standard template to
      match the brains of patients, such as children and the elderly, and eliminates
      the contingency caused by the existing individual-based registration algorithm
      using randomly selected images at any time point as reference templates. By
      improving the rationality and accuracy of the reference template, the registration
      accuracy of the existing registration algorithm is further improved. \n\n\n##
      5. Conclusions \n  \nIn this paper, a method for constructing a custom template
      for fMRI is proposed. Firstly, based on the acquisition of the ABIDE autism
      dataset, the preprocessing of the time-layer correction and head movement correction
      is carried out to prevent the data noise from affecting the quality of the custom
      fMRI reference image construction. Secondly, for the initial registration of
      the fMRI sequence images, the first time-point data are selected as the preliminary
      reference image, the feature points are extracted by the SIFT method, and the
      better GLOH descriptor is used to describe the feature points. After the evaluation
      of the feature points, the spatialtransformation relationship between the feature
      points is used to guide the geometric transformation of the fMRI sequence images
      to be registered. In this process, because there is a certain correlation between
      the fMRI adjacent frame images, in order to retain the correlation information
      of the adjacent frames to the greatest extent, give priority to obtain the corresponding
      matching relationship between the adjacent images, calculate the relationship
      matrix, then find the relationship between each time-point image and the reference
      image through recursion, and map all these images to the coordinate system of
      the reference image. Finally, the weighted average pixel-level fusion method
      is used to fuse the image sequence to obtain a user-defined fMRI reference template.
      In the classical registration algorithm, it is verified that in using the custom
      fMRI template instead of the random time-point image as the reference template,
      the registration accuracy has been improved to a certain extent. \n\n \n```",

      are common but poorly understood. Rates of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

      diffusion imaging to investigate whether strokerelated differences in frontal
      white matter (WM) relate to cognitive impairments. Anterior forceps were isolated
      using tractography and sampled along the tract. Resulting metrics quantified
      frontal WM microstructure. Associations between WM metrics and parent ratings
      of ADHD symptoms (ADHD5 rating scale) and executive functioning (Behavior Rating
      Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF)) were explored. Eightythree children
      were recruited (arterial ischemic stroke [AIS]   n  =26; periventricular venous
      infarction [PVI]   n  =26; controls   n  =31). WM metrics were altered for stroke
      groups compared to controls. Alongtract analyses showed differences in WM metrics
      in areas approximating the lesion as well as more remote differences at midline
      and in the nonlesioned hemisphere. WM metrics correlated with parental ratings
      of ADHD and executive function such that higher diffusivity values were associated
      with poorer function. These findings suggest that underlying microstructure
      of frontal white matter quantified via tractography may provide a relevant biomarker

      with perinatal stroke.\n   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nPerinatal
      stroke is a cerebrovascular injury occurring in the fetus or newborn that affects
      1 in 1000 births (Dunbar etal.,  ). Although predominately known for the subsequent
      sensorimotor deficits manifested as hemiparetic cerebral palsy, perinatal stroke
      may also lead to deficits in cognition and behavior (Bosenbark etal.,  ; Dunbar
      & Kirton,  ; Fuentes etal.,  ; Kirton & deVeber,  ; Murias etal.,  ; Westmacott
      etal.,  ). The two main subtypes of perinatal stroke are arterial ischemic stroke
      (AIS) and periventricular venous infarction (PVI) (Kirton etal.,  ). AIS results
      from an ischemic infarction, commonly involving the middle cerebral artery,
      that often damages cortical and subcortical areas (Kirton & deVeber,  ). Neonatal
      arterial ischemic strokes are diagnosed soon after birth (following seizures),
      while arterial presumed perinatal ischemic strokes may be diagnosed later in
      infancy when early hand preference and hemiparesis become evident (Kirton &
      deVeber,  ). These two AIS types only differ in timing of diagnosis (Dunbar
      & Kirton,  ). By contrast, PVIs are venous infarctions resulting from a germinal
      matrix hemorrhage characterized by damage to the periventricular white matter.
      PVIs typically occur earlier than AIS, usually before 34week gestation (Kirton
      etal., 2008) and damage is restricted to the deep periventricular white matter.
      Both AIS and PVI result in deficits and will likely continue to occur given
      a lack of identified modifiable risk factors or prevention strategies (Dunbar
      & Kirton,  ). Given that these focal injuries occur so early in life, studying
      children after perinatal stroke may give unique insight into neuroplastic compensatory
      mechanisms unfolding during development. \n\nPerinatal strokeinduced brain injury
      may lead to language, behavioral, and cognitive impairments (Bosenbark etal.,  ;
      Fuentes etal.,  ; Khan etal.,  ; Kirton & deVeber,  ; Murias etal.,  ; Westmacott
      etal.,  ; Williams etal.,  ). Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
      is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty concentrating,
      overactivity, and impulsivity. Though ADHD may be perceived as a childhood disorder,
      it can persist well into adulthood often with academic, social, and occupational
      consequences (American Psychiatric Association,  ). ADHD is one of the most
      commonly diagnosed disorders in children and those with perinatal stroke appear
      to be at a much higher risk (3557%) than their peers (57%) (Bosenbark etal.,  ;
      Craig etal.,  ; Everts etal.,  ; Thomas etal.,  ; Westmacott etal.,  ; Westmacott
      etal.,  ; Williams etal.,  ). In addition to having a higher incidence of ADHD,
      children with perinatal stroke often have poorer cognitive and behavioral outcomes
      including poor inhibitory control, language delays, and diverse intellectual
      deficits (Fuentes etal.,  ; Hajek etal.,  ; Kirton & deVeber,  ; Kirton etal.,  ;
      Lo etal.,  ; Murias etal.,  ; Westmacott etal.,  ). The concept of central executive
      functioning encompasses such processes as sustained attention, inhibition, planning,
      and monitoring, particularly during novel problem solving and goaldirected behavior.
      Deficits in executive function can be measured during formal neuropsychological
      assessments using standardized testing protocols, parental reports, and other
      validated assessment tools (Bosenbark etal.,  ; Everts etal.,  ; Ilves etal.,  ;
      Lo etal.,  ; Westmacott etal.,  ). \n\nHow the nature of an early brain lesion
      interacts with developmental plasticity to produce variable outcomes in executive
      function and attention is not understood. Using MRI imaging techniques, differences
      in functionally connected neural networks of children with AIS compared to those
      with PVI and controls have been associated with cognitive function (Carlson
      etal.,  ; Ilves etal.,  ). Structural connectivity methods, including diffusion
      imaging (dMRI), allow for the isolation and characterization of specific white
      matter tracts in vivo. dMRI facilitates investigation of the diffusion of water
      across differing tissues within the brain and how larger molecules such as myelin,
      microtubules, and axons, restricts the movement of water (Basser,  ; Beaulieu,  ).
      Microstructural metrics such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity
      (MD), among others, allow for quantification of the degree of diffusion in underlying
      tissue. Differences may reflect damage or differential development in white
      matter structures. These metrics as well as axial (AD) and radial diffusivity
      (RD) may provide additional information about developmental neuroplastic mechanisms
      following early brain injury. Our group and others have demonstrated the ability
      of tractography to better understand sensory and motor functions in children
      with perinatal stroke (Hodge etal.,  ; Kuczynski etal.,  ; Kuczynski etal.,  ;
      van der Aa etal.,  ). Furthermore, recent evidence has emphasized the essential
      role of widespread network alterations in the nonlesioned hemisphere in determining
      perinatal stroke outcomes (Craig etal., 2020), emphasizing the importance of
      interhemispheric connectivity. \n\nExecutive functions have largely been localized
      to areas of the frontal lobes using multimodal neuroimaging and subsequently,
      the importance of developing rich connectivity among frontal areas and other
      cortical, subcortical and limbic areas of the brain during maturation has been
      demonstrated (Fiske & Holmboe,  ). Previous research using diffusion imaging
      metrics has shown an association between microstructural characteristics of
      frontal white matter, symptomology of ADHD, and executive function (Ashtari
      etal.,  ; Hong etal.,  ; Konrad & Eickhoff,  ; Liston etal.,  ; Makris etal.,  ;
      Wu etal.,  ). Specifically, FA has been found to be lower in the frontal white
      matter of children with ADHD compared to peers (Konrad & Eickhoff,  ; Liston
      etal.,  ; Tremblay etal.,  ; van Ewijk etal.,  ). Elevated MD in the anterior
      forceps of those with ADHD is a consistent finding across literature examining
      frontal tracts (Lawrence etal.,  ; van Ewijk etal.,  ). In adults, elevated
      MD was associated with longer reaction times during the Stroop task (a measure
      of cognitive interference), as well as decreased attention switching speed and
      flexibility (Mamiya etal.,  ). Findings related to other diffusivity metrics
      of the anterior forceps (radial [RD] and axial diffusivity [AD]) have been less
      consistent. AD tends to be higher in those with ADHD, but RD has shown mixed
      results (van Ewijk etal.,  ). In children with nonspecific unilateral cerebral
      palsy, differences in microstructure metrics in the anterior cingulate cortex
      have been associated with cognitive function (Scheck etal.,  ). \n\nGiven the
      high rates of ADHD and executive dysfunction in the perinatal stroke population,
      we investigated whether the character of frontal white matter in children with
      stroke would be altered compared to controls. We used dMRI tractography to examine
      the microstructure of the anterior forceps and possible relationships with parent
      ratings of ADHD and executive functioning. We hypothesized that the microstructure
      of frontal white matter would show disruptions (lower FA and higher MD, RD and
      AD) in children with AIS compared to children without injury (controls), and
      that children with PVI would be similar to controls given that cortical areas
      are typically preserved in this population. Further, we hypothesized that disruptions
      of frontal white matter (but not white matter in posterior lobes) would correlate
      with lower scores on executive function outcomes. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n###
      Participants \n  \nChildren with perinatal stroke were recruited from a populationbased
      research cohort, the Alberta Perinatal Stroke Project (APSP) (Cole etal.,  ).
      Inclusion criteria were (1) MRIconfirmed unilateral perinatal stroke following
      term birth (>36weeks) with no evidence of additional bilateral or diffuse injury
      as confirmed by a pediatric neurologist and (2) MRI scan with anatomical and
      diffusion sequences taken between the ages of 619 years. We excluded participants
      with extreme head motion during the MRI scan (causing venetian blind artifacts
      that disrupted processing) or neurological conditions not attributable to the
      stroke. Control participants with no history of motor or neurological disorder
      were recruited through a community healthy controls program (HICCUP,  ). Control
      participants were all righthanded by selfreport and were similar in age (1 year)
      and sex to the stroke participants. Screening for ADHD and executive dysfunction
      was not performed in the control group; thus, this group likely reflected base
      rates found in a pediatric population with no neurological injury. This study
      was approved by the University of Calgary Research Ethics board. Parents gave
      written informed consent and eligible participants gave assent to take part
      in the study. \n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nImaging was performed at the
      Alberta Children''s Hospital using a 3 Tesla MRI scanner (GE MR750w, GE Healthcare,
      Waukesha, WI) with a 32channel head coil. All participants completed the standard
      research neuroplasticity protocol used at this site, which included a T1weighted
      (T W) anatomical and diffusion (dMRI) scan. A fastspoiled gradient echo sequence
      was used to obtain highresolution T W images axially (1mm isotropic voxels,
      repetition time [TR]=8.6ms, echo time [TE]=3.2ms, flip angle=11 , FOV=256mm,
      acquisition time=5:10). An axial diffusion spinecho echoplanar image scan was
      also acquired (32 diffusion directions;   b  =0 s/mm  [3], 750 s/mm ; 2.5mm
      isotropic voxels; 60 slices; TR=11500ms; TE=69ms; acquisition time=6:45). \n\n\n###
      Image processing \n  \nAnatomical T W scans underwent segmentation into cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF), gray, and white matter using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12;
      Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL London). An estimate of total intracranial
      volume was calculated by summing volumes of CSF, gray, and white matter. Segmentations
      were also used to generate a gray matterwhite matter interface mask, which was
      subsequently used to restrict the generation of reconstructed streamlines to
      only white matter, termed anatomically constrained tractography (Smith etal.,  ).
      Anatomical scans and masks were linearly transformed into diffusion space using
      FSL''s   FLIRT   followed by nonlinear transformation using   FNIRT   (Andersson
      etal.,  ; Jenkinson etal.,  ). \n\nThe FSL FDT toolbox was used to correct eddy
      current and small head motion for the dMRI scan (Jenkinson etal.,  ). Color
      maps showing directionality of diffusion was calculated using MRtrix3''s   dwi2tensor   command
      followed by   tensor2metric   (Tournier etal.,  ). Quality assurance was performed
      before and after color maps were generated, assessed by two researchers slicebyslice
      axially (BTC and AJH). Reconstructed tracts were generated using MRtrix3''s   tckgen   using
      the   tensor_prob   tracking algorithm (FA cutoff=0.2; step size=0.1mm; angle
      threshold=45; 5000 streamlines; length range=5100mm). \n\n\n### Regions of interest
      selection \n  \nRegions of interest (ROIs; Figure ) were selected based on an
      anatomical model of the corpus callosum (Hofer & Frahm,  ). A color map indicating
      directionality of water diffusion was overlaid on a T W anatomical scan. In
      the axial view, the cursor was placed at the midline of the genu of the corpus
      collosum where the color map indicated primarily leftright diffusion direction.
      In the sagittal view, the hook of the genu was then traced and filled to isolate
      the anterior forceps (Figure ). \n  \nRegion of interest placement and resulting
      representative anterior and posterior forceps tracts. (a) The colorcoded fractional
      anisotropy map was overlaid on the T W anatomical image and a sagittal slice
      was selected at the midline where the corpus callosum is seen in full profile
      (red). Two regions of interest were drawn on the hooks of the genu (cyan) and
      splenium (magenta). (b) Resulting sagittal view of the reconstructed anterior
      and posterior forceps. (c) White matter metrics were measured from 11 tract
      samples along the anterior forceps along an arc defined using two anterior points
      (yellow circles) and one midline point (cyan circle). Representative tracts
      shown for a (d) controls, (e) AIS, and (f) PVI participant. Tract colors represent
      plane of projection. AIS, arterial ischemic stroke; PVI, periventricular venous
      infarction \n  \nThe posterior forceps were also investigated for comparison
      and to assist in establishing functional specificity of subsets of the frontal
      white matter. A similar process was used to create the tracts for the posterior
      forceps, using an ROI placed over the splenium at the base of the posterior
      bulb of the corpus callosum at midline. Exclusion ROIs were drawn to demarcate
      spurious streamlines (typically the cingulum bundle) that were subsequently
      excluded during tract reconstruction. \n\nFor the anterior and posterior forceps
      separately, ROIs were used as seeds to select 5000 streamlines passing through
      them. This streamline threshold was chosen given previous findings of reliable
      white matter metrics using this degree of sampling (Reid etal.,  ). Resulting
      tracts were binarized using   tckmap   and then overlaid onto the tensor image
      where mean values of FA, MD, AD, and RD for the entire tract were extracted
      using   tensor2metric   and   mrstats   (Tournier etal.,  ). \n\n\n### Intrarater
      reliability \n  \nTo assess the reliability of ROI placements and reconstruction
      of tracts, extraction of mean white matter metrics for the anterior forceps
      were repeated one month later by the same tractographer (NL) on a subset of
      14 randomly selected participants (17% of the total sample). \n\n\n### Alongtract
      white matter metrics \n  \nTo investigate possible diaschisis (degeneration
      of brain structures spatially displaced from the primary lesion), white matter
      metrics were additionally measured at 11 points along the length of the reconstructed
      anterior forceps. The sampling points were manually determined by noting the
      coordinates of three reference points defining an arc covering the main body
      of the tract for each participant (in native space). Two anterior points of
      the forceps tract (yellow circles in Figure ) were identified by overlaying
      the forceps track reconstruction over the anatomical T1weighted image and locating
      the anteriormost point in each frontal lobe projection before the tracts fanned
      out laterally/medially. The midpoint of this arc (cyan circle in Figure ) was
      identified by varying the opacity of the overlaid track file so that the underlying
      anatomical axial slice could also be seen while tract coordinates were noted
      where they crossed the midline. The   tckresample   function in MRtrix3 calculated
      locations for 11 equidistant points along the reference arc and using a line
      perpendicular to the tangent of the arc, white matter metrics were extracted
      from these 11 samples. Resulting white matter metric values were reassigned
      for children with leftside stroke to match rightside stroke such that nonlesioned/dominant
      (segments 15), midline (segment 6), and lesioned/nondominant (segments 711)
      were compared appropriately among groups. \n\n\n### Lesion volume \n  \nLesion
      volumes (in cubic centimeters [cc]) were measured using the 3dimensional ROI
      selection tool in MRIcron (Rorden & Brett,  ) based on T W image intensity.
      For the AIS group, the center of the lesion was selected on an axial slice and
      the resulting dilated ROI was verified and adjusted manually (if necessary)
      on every axial slice. For the PVI group, bilateral ventricle volumes were measured
      as above and ventricle asymmetry (lesion size) was calculated as the absolute
      value of the difference between the two volumes as such: PVI lesion size=| lesioned
      hemisphere ventricle volume  nonlesioned ventricle volume |. \n\n\n### Cognitive
      function \n  \nParents completed questionnaires examining executive function
      and symptoms of ADHD as part of a larger clinical neuropsychological assessment.
      The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) was used to assess
      executive function in children and adolescents (Gioia etal.,  ). It is a parental
      measure composed of 86 items comprising eight clinical scales. Three of the
      eight scales measure behavioral regulation (inhibit, shift, emotional control).
      The remaining five are related to metacognition (initiate, working memory, plan/organize,
      organization of materials, monitor) as well as an additional global executive
      composite score. The ADHD rating scale (ADHD5; DuPaul etal.,  ) assesses levels
      of ADHD symptomology over the previous 6 months. It is composed of 18 questions,
      half pertaining to inattention and half to hyperactivity. Higher scores on both
      questionnaires reflect a higher degree of dysfunction. Percentiles (for ADHD5)
      and T score values (for BRIEF) in relation to agematched normative peer groups
      are reported. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nThe Statistical Package for
      Social Sciences version 28 (IBM SPSS, Armonk, New York) and R (R Core Team,  )
      were used for data analysis. All data were tested for normality using ShapiroWilk.
      Demographic differences among the three participant groups were explored using
      KruskalWallis (age), MannWhitney U (lesion size) and chisquare (sex) tests.
      Intrarater reliability (IRR) for the FA and diffusivity metrics of the anterior
      forceps were assessed via an interclass correlation (McGraw & Wong,  ) using
      Cronbach''s     . Nonparametric independent samples (KruskalWallis) tests were
      performed comparing mean FA, MD, RD, and AD of the anterior and posterior forceps
      between the AIS, PVI, and control groups along with appropriate pairwise post
      hoc tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Effect sizes
      are expressed as etasquared ( ). Streamline count was compared among groups
      using a nonparametric Quade''s analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using estimated
      total intracranial volume as a covariate. Alongtract group differences in white
      matter metrics (FA, MD, AD, RD) were tested using four linear mixed models (LMM).
      LMMs were performed in R (using the GAMLj module in Jamovi; Jamovi,  ). Age,
      group, segment, and the group by segment interaction term were used as fixed
      factors and patient was used as a random factor in the models. Post hoc tests
      explored group differences alongtract segments and multiple comparisons were
      controlled using the Holm correction. \n\nSpearman''s correlations explored
      associations between age, white matter metrics, and cognitive function. Partial
      Spearman''s correlations (controlling for age) were subsequently used to examine
      correlations between mean tract FA, MD, RD, and AD of the anterior and posterior
      forceps of the stroke patients and their parental rating scores from the BRIEF
      and ADHD5 questionnaires. Statistical threshold was set to   p  <.05 and Bonferroni
      corrected   p  value thresholds are given for comparison. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS
      \n  \n### Population \n  \nInitially, 89 participants were recruited, however
      scans from six children were excluded due to head motion during scanning (AIS   n  =5;
      PVI   n  =1). The final sample thus included 83 participants (AIS   n  =26;
      PVI   n  =26, controls   n  =31). A subset of stroke participants had cognitive
      assessments (ADHD:   n  =20; BRIEF   n  =19). Age (AIS mean ageSD=13.024.2 years;
      PVI age=11.933.5; controls age=13.253.6 years) and sex distribution between
      groups was comparable (age:   H  =1.65,   p  =.44; sex:  =0.79,   p  =.67) and
      the AIS group had larger lesions than the PVI group (  H  =5.0,   p  <.001).
      Average time between scanning and cognitive assessment was 2.81.47 years (range:
      0.487.1 years). Additional demographic information and cognitive function scores
      are presented in Table . \n  \nDemographic information and parent ratings of

      was excellent between the two tractography sessions for the four microstructure
      variables (FA      =.99, MD      =.90, RD      =.95, AD      =.92). \n\n\n###
      Age correlations \n  \nParticipant age was moderately correlated with some white
      matter metrics of both the anterior (MD   r  =.22,   p  =.045; RD   r  =.24,   p  =.03)
      and posterior forceps (FA   r  =.34,   p  =.03) for the entire sample (all groups).
      When age and WM variables were investigated by participant group separately,
      controls showed associations for the anterior (FA   r  =.41,   p  =.02; MD   r  =.38,   p  =.03;
      RD   r  =.47,   p  =0.007) but not posterior forceps. The PVI group showed associations
      between age and white matter metrics for posterior (FA   r  =.58,   p  =.002;
      AD   r  =.41,   p  =.04) but not anterior forceps and the AIS group showed no
      associations with age. For the stroke participants, age was also highly and
      systematically correlated with higher executive dysfunction as assessed by the
      BRIEF (Shift   r  =.54,   p  =.02; Behavior Regulation Index   r  =.51,   p  =.03;
      Initiate   r  =.49,   p  =.03; Plan/Organize   r  =.62,   p  =.005; Organization
      of Materials   r  =.56,   p  =.01; Monitor   r  =.66,   p  =.002; Metacognition   r  =.65,   p  =.003;
      Global Executive Composite   r  =.64,   p  =.003) such that older participants
      showed poorer function. ADHD ratings were not significantly correlated with
      age. \n\n\n### Differences in white matter metrics among participant groups
      \n  \nAnterior and posterior forceps were successfully reconstructed in all
      participants (Figure ). As illustrated in Figure , mean FA in the anterior forceps
      was different among groups (  H  =6.3,   p  =.043,  =.08, Table ) such that
      FA was lower for AIS compared to controls (  p  =.048). Anterior forceps FA
      for children with PVI was not different compared to AIS or controls (  p  =.199
      and   p  =1.000, respectively). Streamline count was not different among groups
      (  F  =1.4,   p  =.26). There were no group differences for mean MD, AD, or
      RD of the anterior forceps (MD:   H  =1.1,   p  =.58,  =.01; AD:   H  =5.1,   p  =.08,  =.06;
      RD:   H  =0.3,   p  =.85,  =.004). \n  \nMean FA for both (a) anterior and (b)
      posterior forceps showed lower fractional anisotropy (FA) for the AIS group
      compared to the control group. FA values along the anterior forceps tract varied
      between (c) AIS vs. controls and (d) PVI vs controls. Shaded areas denote where
      FA values for the patient group tract segments are lower compared to the control
      group. Error bars are standard error of the mean. Mean diffusivity of the anterior
      forceps was associated with parent ratings of (e) hyperactivity and (f) inattention.
      AIS, arterial ischemic stroke; PVI, periventricular venous infarction. Mean
      diffusivity is expressed in scientific notation (10  mm /s). *  p  <.05, **  p  <.01
      \n    \nMean white matter metrics by participant group \n    \nFor the posterior
      forceps, mean FA varied among groups (  H  =11.2,   p  =.004,  =.14). FA for
      the AIS group was significantly lower compared to controls (  p  =.002) and
      the FA of the PVI group fell in between AIS and controls, but was not different
      than either (  p  =.218 and   p  =.422, respectively, Figure , Table ). Streamline
      count for posterior forceps showed differences among groups (  F  =8.3,   p=  .001),
      specifically between AIS versus controls (  t  =4.1,   p  <.001), and between
      AIS versus PVI (  t  =2.4,   p  =.02) such that AIS had fewer streamlines. AIS
      had higher MD in the posterior region (  H  =17.8,   p  <.001,  =.22) than both
      the PVI and controls (  p  <.001 and   p  =.016, respectively). MD in the posterior
      forceps of controls compared to PVI did not differ (  p  =.543). RD (  H  =23.7,   p  <.001,  =.29)
      was higher in AIS compared to both PVI and controls (  p  =.008 and   p  <.001,
      respectively) and PVI and controls did not differ (  p  =.229). \n\n\n### Alongtract
      white matter metrics \n  \nFA varied along the anterior forceps for all groups
      with the highest values observed at the three midline samples and lowest in
      more lateral areas (Figure  and  ). LMM showed significant main effects of group
      (  F  =4.42,   p  =.015), segment (  F  =367.8,   p  <.001) as well as a group
      by segment interaction (  F  =3.91,   p  <.001). Age was not a significant main
      effect (  F  =.31,   p  =.582) for the FA model. \n\nLMM results for MD showed
      significant main effects of age (  F  =4.93,   p  =.029), group (  F  =3.51,   p  =.034),
      segment (  F  =5.18,   p  <.001) as well as a group by segment interaction (  F  =2.21,   p  =.002).
      AD LMM results showed significant main effects of age (  F  =7.75,   p  =.007),
      segment (  F  =365.7,   p  <.001) as well as a group by segment interaction
      (  F  =5.18,   p  <.001). RD model results showed significant main effects of
      group (  F  =4.05,   p  =.021), segment (  F  =193.4,   p  <.001) as well as
      a group by segment interaction (  F  =3.10,   p  =<.001). \n\nPost hoc tests
      (Table , Figure ) performed for each alongtract segment demonstrated group differences
      in white matter metrics between AIS and controls in the lesioned (segments 9
      and 10) and nonlesioned hemispheres (segments 3 and 4) as well as at the midline
      (segment 6). The PVI group showed largely similar white matter metrics to controls
      along the anterior forceps except for individual segments in the lesioned (segment
      8) and nonlesioned (segment 4). \n  \nHolmcorrected significance   p   values
      for a longtract contrasts between participant groups for four white matter metrics
      \n    \n\n### White matter metrics and cognitive function \n  \nA subset of
      mean anterior forceps white matter metrics were associated with measures of
      cognitive function (Table , Figure  and ). Higher ADHD parent ratings were consistently
      associated with higher diffusivity values such as MD (Hyperactivity   r  =.65,   p  =.002;
      Inattention   r  =.63,   p  =.004; Total ADHD rating   r  =.61,   p  =.005)
      and AD (Hyperactivity   r  =.46,   p  =.05; Inattention   r  =.68,   p  =.001;
      Total ADHD rating   r  =.55,   p  =.014). A subset of these associations remained
      when the time interval between cognitive assessment and scan was used as an
      additional covariate (Hyperactivity and AD   r  =.48,   p  =.04; Total ADHD
      and MD   r  =.48,   p  =.045; Total ADHD and AD   r  =.56,   p  =.02). Correlations
      between hyperactivity and MD (  r  =.65,   p=  .002) and inattention and AD
      (  r  =.68,   p=  .001) remained significant after Bonferroni correction. FA
      of anterior forceps was not associated with ADHD ratings. \n  \nAssociations
      between anterior forceps white matter microstructure metrics and clinical executive
      functioning skills \n    \nFor executive functioning, a subset of BRIEF subscales
      were associated with mean FA of the anterior forceps (Emotional Control   r  =.60,   p  =.009;
      Behavior Regulation Index   r  =.60,   p  =.008). Parent ratings of working
      memory function was also strongly associated with measures of diffusivity (MD
      [  r  =.51,   p  =.03]; AD [  r  =.50,   p  =.03]) such that poorer white matter
      metrics were associated with poorer executive function. All of these associations
      remained when the time interval between cognitive assessment and scan was used
      as an additional covariate for FA (Emotional Control   r  =.60,   p  =.01; Behavior
      Regulation Index   r  =.62,   p  =.008) and for MD and AD (Working Memory vs
      MD   r  =.49,   p  =.04; Working Memory vs. AD   r  =.49,   p  =.046). Additional
      associations were identified between BRIEF subscales and AD (Inhibit   r  =.57,   p  =.02;
      Behavioral Regulation Index   r  =.52,   p  =.03; Global Executive Composite   r  =.53,   p  =.03).
      No associations between white matter metrics and BRIEF executive function ratings
      were observed after Bonferroni correction. \n\nNone of the posterior forceps
      mean white matter metrics showed significant correlations with the ADHD or BRIEF
      measures. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nUsing dMRI tractography, we have shown
      group differences in underlying microstructure of the forceps in children with
      perinatal stroke compared to controls. Specifically, children with AIS showed
      disrupted white matter metrics in both anterior and posterior forceps compared
      to those with periventricular venous infarction and controls. Alongtract analyses
      showed spatially specific differences in metrics suggestive of remote diaschisis
      and possible compensatory neuroplasticity in the nonlesioned hemisphere. Frontal
      (but not posterior) white matter metrics were associated with parental ratings
      of ADHD symptoms, such that higher white matter diffusivity values were associated
      with poorer function. These findings suggest that underlying microstructure
      of frontal white matter quantified via tractography can provide a relevant biomarker
      of attention and hyperactivity behaviors in children with perinatal stroke.
      \n\n### Anterior forceps \n  \nUsing dMRI tractography to isolate the anterior
      forceps in the frontal lobe, we demonstrated that underlying microstructure
      (i.e., fractional anisotropy) of frontal white matter in AIS participants appeared
      to be altered. This finding is consistent with previous literature investigating
      frontal white matter in unilateral cerebral palsy reporting lower FA values
      in anterior cingulate cortex and superior frontal gyrus (Scheck etal.,  ). This
      is also consistent with the wider ADHD literature that demonstrates lower FA
      values and higher diffusivity values in frontal white matter of children with
      ADHD (Konrad & Eickhoff,  ; Liston etal.,  ; Tremblay etal.,  ; van Ewijk etal.,  ).
      Given that these reports use mean metrics extracted from large white matter
      structures, it is compelling that group differences can still be detected despite
      using methods with relatively low spatial resolution. \n\n\n### Alongtract analyses
      and secondary degeneration \n  \nUsing alongtract analyses, we found spatially
      specific differences in microstructure metrics in the frontal white matter of
      children with AIS. Alongtract analyses provided more spatially specific quantification
      of the spatial extent of possible diaschisis and Wallerian degeneration in areas
      displaced from the primary lesion allowing for sensitive group comparisons evidenced
      by significant group by segment interactions in linear mixed models. Our findings
      suggest that in addition to primary stroke damage to lateral frontal white matter,
      secondary degeneration of more medial white matter may also underlie group differences
      in frontal tracts. Such secondary damage of the motor network via diaschisis
      (Craig etal.,  ; Craig, Olsen etal.,  ; Srivastava etal.,  ) and/or Wallerian
      degeneration (De Vries etal.,  ; Kirton etal.,  ) has been previously documented
      in this population. In the current study, some children showed white matter
      metric values similar to controls while others showed large departures, supporting
      the idea of heterogeneous and patientspecific secondary degeneration of connected
      structures in cognitive networks. \n\n\n### Compensatory neuroplasticity \n  \nOur
      findings also highlight areas in the nonlesioned hemisphere that showed   higher   group
      mean FA values in both stroke groups compared to controls. This may relate to
      compensatory developmental neuroplasticity in the nonlesioned hemisphere, though
      larger studies are needed to more specifically explore associations with cognitive
      function. Initial studies in this population have demonstrated differences in
      thalamic (Craig, Carlson etal.,  ) and cerebellar volumes (Craig, Olsen etal.,  )
      as well as more complex differences in graph theory metrics quantifying overall
      structural connectivity of the nonlesioned hemisphere (Craig etal.,  ). Such
      metrics have been strongly associated with motor function, again suggesting
      functionally relevant compensatory processes in the nonlesioned hemisphere.
      We have also documented spatially specific differences in cortical thickness/volumes,
      gyrification, and sulcal depth (Shinde etal.,  ) as well as myelination (Yu
      etal.,  ) in the nonlesioned hemisphere after perinatal stroke. Given the heterogeneity
      of direct strokeinduced damage and the possibility of varying degrees of remote
      diaschisis and/or neuroplastic compensation in the nonlesioned hemisphere, it
      is perhaps not surprising that there is large variability in cognitive functioning
      within this group. \n\nGroup differences in frontal white matter were not as
      apparent in children with PVI, possibly because PVIinduced damage is largely
      restricted to subcortical periventricular white matter rather than cortex. Because
      PVI occurs earlier in brain development, there may also be more opportunity
      for neuroplastic compensation. Indeed, for three regions of the anterior forceps,
      the PVI group appeared to have   higher   FA of frontal white matter compared
      to controls. Children with PVI are more likely to show motor disabilities (especially
      of the lower limb) rather than cognitive disabilities given the periventricular
      location of primary white matter damage and cortical sparing (Dunbar & Kirton,  ;
      Kirton etal.,  ). Consistent with this, our sample contained fewer PVI participants
      (  n  =6) than AIS (  n  =14) referred for clinical neuropsychological assessment
      reflecting relatively intact cognition and fewer concerns worthy of referral.
      \n\n\n### ADHD \n  \nAssociations between structure and function add additional
      clinical interest. It is now well established that children with perinatal stroke
      show a higher prevalence of ADHD compared to children without neurologic injury
      (Bosenbark etal.,  ; Fuentes etal.,  ; Kirton & deVeber,  ; Murias etal.,  ;
      Thomas etal.,  ). We have demonstrated systematic associations between frontal
      white matter microstructure disruptions (higher diffusivity values) and parent
      ratings of hyperactivity, inattention, and total ADHD scores consistent with
      previous studies (Konrad & Eickhoff,  ; Lawrence etal.,  ; Liston etal.,  ).
      Lower diffusion anisotropy, leading to higher MD, AD and RD values, is thought
      to reflect more unrestricted diffusion via underlying differences in axonal
      membranes, neurofibrils, or cellular density which may in turn be modulated
      by degree of myelination (Beaulieu,  ). The apparently disrupted white matter
      microstructure in frontal anterior forceps as measured by three diffusivity
      variables appears to be associated with higher parental ADHD ratings. These
      findings are consistent with previous literature reporting higher diffusivity
      values in children with ADHD (Liston etal.,  ; van Ewijk etal.,  ) as well as
      correlations with parental reports of inattention (Lawrence etal.,  ). \n\nAlthough
      MD values showed significant correlations with ADHD ratings, FA did not. It
      could be that since FA is a complex ratio between diffusion in multiple orientations,
      it provides a less specific quantification of underlying microstructure compared
      to other, more directional, microstructure metrics. Further, FA is more affected
      by underlying white matter structural organization (such as crossing fibers)
      compared to diffusivity values, which may also contribute to this disparity
      (van Ewijk etal.,  ). Previous studies investigating ADHD have reported this
      same pattern where diffusivity metrics show functional correlations and FA does
      not (Lawrence etal.,  ). \n\n\n### Executive function \n  \nStrong correlations
      were found between age and executive functioning in our perinatal stroke sample
      despite the use of scaled scores expressed in relation to agematched normative
      values. Deficits in cognitive functioning may not become apparent until later
      in development as parental expectations change as children age (Bosenbark etal.,  ).
      However, this age correlation could alternatively reflect an altered frontal
      white matter developmental trajectory for children with perinatal stroke. If
      the typical trajectory of cognitive development has been arrested, delayed,
      or prolonged due to early strokeinduced damage (Westmacott etal.,  ), more deficits
      in executive function may become apparent as children age. These may manifest
      as strong correlations between age and parental ratings of dysfunction. Specifically,
      deficits in children with AIS compared to controls have previously been noted
      in measures of attention, verbal retrieval, inhibitory control, flexibility/shifting,
      planning/organization, and processing speed (Bosenbark etal.,  ). As a group,
      our perinatal stroke sample showed broadly normal executive functioning as indicated
      by group average measures; however, a very wide range was observed on all subscales
      measured. Clearly, cognitive consequences of direct and secondary damage due
      to stroke are heterogeneous, varying widely among patients. \n\nParental ratings
      of executive functioning did not appear to be as highly associated with anterior
      forceps white matter metrics as ADHD ratings. Although some correlations were
      fairly strong (  r  >.5), many associations did not reach statistical significance.
      MD and AD showed positive correlations with working memory whereas AD had positive
      associations with measures of inhibition, behavioral regulation index, and global
      executive composite. Taken together, this reveals a pattern of poorer ability
      to regulate behavior corresponding to disruptions in underlying microstructure
      of frontal white matter. This is consistent with our current findings of higher
      ratings of inattention and hyperactivity on the ADHD rating scale and previously
      reported difficulties with inattention after perinatal AIS (Bosenbark etal.,  ).
      \n\nThere was an absence of significant correlations between white matter metrics
      and measures of metacognition such as planning, organizing, and monitoring,
      although prior studies have suggested associations in children with AIS (Bosenbark
      etal.,  ). It could be that these deficits do occur in this population, but
      are not associated with white matter metrics of frontal white matter alone.
      These patterns may be better elucidated by studies examining more frontal white
      matter tracts beyond anterior forceps, as well as other neuroimaging markers
      such as white matter volumes, cortical thickness of frontal cortical areas such
      as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), or functional connectivity measures
      of wider attentional networks. \n\nOne unexpected finding of the current study
      was the absence of widespread negative correlations between FA values and executive
      functioning. Although other studies have reported this same finding (Scheck
      etal.,  ), we expected to find that higher FA in frontal white matter would
      correspond to better function. Further, the two associations we did identify
      with emotional control and behavioral regulation index were in the strongly
      positive direction such that higher FA was associated with poorer executive
      function. As mentioned above, FA is a composite ratio of multiple diffusion
      orientations and is influenced by many factors such as degree of axonal packing,
      presence of microtubules, myelination, and crossing fibers (Beaulieu,  ). The
      reasons underlying the absence of negative correlations remain unclear; however,
      they may be related to the sensitivity of FA to multiple underlying tissue properties,
      its nonspecificity, and the apparent heterogeneity of FAbehavior relationships
      (Lazari etal.,  ). \n\n\n### Posterior forceps \n  \nAs hypothesized, the posterior
      forceps (our comparison tract) appeared to be functionally independent, showing
      no correlations with executive dysfunction and/or ADHD symptoms. This finding
      does suggest that differences in frontal white matter after perinatal stroke
      are functionally specific, at least for the measures presented here, and do
      not appear to be associated with differences in posterior white matter. Interestingly,
      posterior white matter did show group differences in volume and underlying microstructure
      for the AIS group compared to controls. This could be due to direct strokeinduced
      damage since infarctions of the middle cerebral artery can directly damage posterior
      visual areas in some cases. In children without direct lesion damage, it also
      supports the concept of secondary degeneration of areas displaced from primary
      stroke damage as may be the case with the anterior forceps. These differences
      also suggest possible deficits in functions mediated by the dorsal visual stream
      and projections to parietal sensory integration areas after perinatal stroke
      (Knyazeva,  ). \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nCertain limitations of the current
      study must be acknowledged. ROI placement for tract reconstruction was manually
      performed by one tractographer and thus may have been somewhat subjective compared
      to automated techniques. This is a ubiquitous challenge for studies using manual
      tractography but is necessary in this population since the brain anatomy following
      stroke is typically displaced rendering automated and atlasbased tractography
      methods ineffective. This limitation was somewhat mitigated by our excellent
      intrarater reliability of microstructure values. We used tensorbased metrics
      for white matter microstructure quantification, which are more conservative
      in streamline selection compared to more complex techniques such as constrained
      spherical deconvolution (CSD) (Tournier etal.,  ). In addition, using a higher
      bvalue, multishell acquisitions, and better eddycurrent distortion corrections
      may have been more sensitive in detecting differences in WM metrics. Further,
      more directly modeling free water components of the diffusion signal (Pasternak
      etal.,  ) would have likely provided additional insight into underlying anatomical
      architecture. Alongtract segments were in approximately the same position for
      each participant given that sampling occurred in patient space. Head motion
      is a challenge for pediatric neuroimaging, especially for participants who may
      have attentional and cognitive disorders. Those unable to successfully complete
      an MRI had their scans discarded, ultimately leaving an underrepresentation
      of more severe cases. \n\nParticipants with AIS were overrepresented compared
      to PVI in the subset of participants with cognitive testing as they were part
      of a cohort referred for clinical neuropsychological assessment. Comparative
      measures of ADHD and executive function were not acquired for the control group
      though populationbased normative scales were available for calculating percentiles
      and T scores. ADHD and executive functioning for the stroke groups were based
      on parental report, which is informative but may be prone to subjectivity of
      such parent report. Prospective, standardized cognitive testing of participants
      themselves could have been utilized to more directly measure cognitive function
      and may have provided different associations with white matter metrics. The
      timing between cognitive assessments and MRI was greater than one year. As neuroimaging
      metrics can change with experience and age, caution should be taken in interpreting
      this association when measures are taken at different times. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION
      \n  \nBased on diffusion tensor imagingbased tractography, spatially specific
      differences in underlying microstructure of the anterior forceps occur in children
      with perinatal stroke and are associated with stroke type and behavioral outcomes
      of executive function and attention. Furthering our understanding of associations
      between cognitive outcomes and the associated underlying brain differences that
      accompany them may facilitate the advancement of biomarker identification. \n\n\n##

      Abstract\n \nPurpose: Violent subjects were demonstrated to exhibit abnormal
      brain structures; however, the brain changes may be different between criminals
      committing affective (VA), predatory violence (VP), and non-violence (NV). Therefore,
      the purpose of this study was to compare the differences in brain structures
      and psychological characteristics between VA, VP, and NV offenders. Methods:
      Twenty male criminal subjects (7 VP; 6 VA; and 7 NV) offenders; and twenty age-matched
      male healthy non-criminals were enrolled in this study. All subjects received
      psychological assessments as well as magnetic resonance imaging scans of the
      brain. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to understand the differences
      among four groups with Bonferroni correction. The voxel-based morphometry and
      voxel-wise diffusion tensor imaging analyses were performed to compare the gray
      matter (GM) volume and white matter (WM) integrity between the groups. In significant
      regions, a Spearman correlation analysis was performed to understand the relationship
      between the brain changes and psychological scores. Results: The ANOVA analysis
      showed that AUDIT scores were significantly different among four groups, but
      no significant group difference was noted after Bonferroni correction. The imaging
      comparisons further demonstrated that the VP and NV offenders exhibited significant
      alterations of WM and GM tissues in the rectus and superior temporal gyrus,
      respectively. In addition, the VP offenders exhibited greater GM volumes than
      VA offenders in the right middle frontal gyrus, and NV offenders had greater
      GM volumes than VP offenders in the bilateral thalamus. Conclusion: We concluded
      that the VA, VP, and NV groups exhibited different degrees of alterations in
      GM and WM tissues in regions involved in emotion and cognition. \n \n\n# Body\n
      \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nViolent individuals have been demonstrated to exhibit
      abnormalities in brain structure and function [ , , , ]. There have been many
      studies that showed structural and functional abnormalities in the brains of
      antisocial individuals. Some hypotheses have proposed a link between antisocial
      behavior and deficits in certain brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex,
      temporal cortex, insula, amygdala, hippocampus, para-hippocampus, anterior cingulate
      gyrus, and posterior cingulate gyrus [ , , ]. Among these brain regions, the
      prefrontal cortex has been recognized as the most crucial brain structure that
      determines violent and antisocial behaviors in these aggressive individuals
      [ , ]. \n\nThe results of a previous meta-analysis showed significantly reduced
      prefrontal structure and function in antisocial individuals [ ]. These findings
      confirmed the replicability of prefrontal structural and functional impairments
      in antisocial populations and highlighted the involvement of the orbitofrontal,
      dorsolateral frontal, and anterior cingulate cortices in antisocial behaviors.
      Nevertheless, in the meta-analysis study, five studies were performed on antisocial
      subjects who had conducted nonviolent crimes, and seventeen were performed on
      antisocial subjects with comorbid psychiatric diagnoses [ ]. Therefore, it will
      be of value to investigate further regarding different violent behaviors and
      their association with brain abnormalities. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge,
      there has been only one previous brain imaging study that used positron emission
      tomography to investigate the brain differences between affective, impulsive,
      and planned violence [ ]. The results supported the hypothesis that emotional,
      unplanned impulsive murderers were less able to regulate and control aggressive
      impulses generated from subcortical structures due to deficient prefrontal regulation.
      However, it remains unclear whether the gray matter (GM) volume and white matter
      (WM) integrity are different among offenders committing crimes with impulsive/affective
      violence (VA), predatory violence (VP), and non-violent (NV) offenders. \n\nIn
      the present study, we hypothesized that VA and VP offenders may exhibit different
      brain structures in regions involved in emotion and cognition. Therefore, the
      purpose of this study was to investigate the differences of GM and WM tissues
      between VA, VP, NV, and healthy control (HC) groups using voxel-based morphometry
      (VBM) and voxel-wise diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), respectively. \n\n\n##
      2. Materials and Methods \n  \nThis prospective study was approved by the local
      institutional review board of Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital (protocol
      number: VGHKS93-CT2-09). This study enrolled 20 right-handed male offenders
      who were further separated into 3 sub-groups by their records of court verdict:
      six offenders had committed affective violence (VA group), seven offenders had
      committed predatory violence (VP group), and seven had committed non-violent
      crime (NV group). The VA offenders were defined as the subjects who impulsively
      or affectively committed violent crime. The VP offenders were defined as the
      subjects who purposely planned to commit violent crime with detailed documentation
      in the court records. The NV offenders were defined as the subjects who committed
      non-violent crime based on the documents in court record. In addition, 20 age-matched
      right-handed male non-criminal healthy controls (HC group) were enrolled for
      comparisons. All subjects underwent psychological assessments as well as magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain after providing their written informed
      consent. Individuals with metal implants, claustrophobia, neurological disorders,
      or any space-occupying lesion in the brain MRI were excluded from this study.
      \n\n### 2.1. Psychological Assessments \n  \nThree psychological questionnaires
      were arranged for each participating subject to complete. Alcohol consumption
      was evaluated using the alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT) which
      is a ten-item scale consisting of three dimensions: alcohol consumption, alcohol
      dependence, and alcohol-related problems. The highest score that can be obtained
      from AUDIT is 40 [ ] and scores above 8 indicate a high risk of alcohol use
      disorder. The questionnaire correlates highly with other alcohol screening tools
      and a high internal consistency (0.75 to 0.94) has been reported in various
      studies [ ]. Impulsiveness was assessed using self-report Dickmans impulsivity
      inventory (DII) [ ]. This instrument is a self-report questionnaire developed
      to measure two types of impulsivity, namely, functional and dysfunctional impulsivity.
      Dysfunctional impulsivity is the tendency to make quick decisions and act with
      less forethought when this tendency is non-optimal or a source of difficulty.
      Functional impulsivity is the tendency to make quick decisions and act with
      little forethought when it is optimal and beneficial. It consists of 23 items
      with a true/false answer and the Cronbachs alpha was 0.81 for dysfunctional
      impulsivity, and 0.78 for functional impulsivity. We used the dysfunctional
      impulsivity score in the final analysis. Hostility was measured using the BussDurkee
      hostility inventory (BDHI), which was an instrument to measure the aggression
      potential of individuals [ ]. It is a 34-point Likert-type self-report inventory
      with each item scored between 1 and 5. The total aggression level is calculated
      with the total score and high scores indicate that the aggression tendency is
      high. We used the total aggression score in our final analysis. \n\n\n### 2.2.
      MRI Acquisition \n  \nMRI data were acquired from all participants on a 1.5T
      MR scanner (Signa HDx, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with an 8-channel
      phased-array head coil. Each subject was scanned in a supine position with head-first
      orientation. In this study, tri-planar scans were firstly performed for localization,
      then a calibration dataset was acquired for the reconstruction of parallel imaging.
      After conventional T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and fluid-attenuated inversion
      recovery images were acquired, whole-brain high-resolution T1-weighted imaging
      data (TR/TE/TI = 9.1/4.2/500 ms, flip angle = 20, array coil spatial sensitivity
      encoding technique factor = 2, field-of-view = 250  188 mm, matrix size = 256  192,
      slice thickness = 1.2 mm, number of slice = 124, and number of excitation =
      1), and DTI data (TR/TE = 10,000/77 ms, field-of-view = 280  280 mm, matrix
      size = 128  128, slice thickness = 4.4 mm, number of direction = 15, number
      of excitation = 3, acceleration factor = 2, scan time = 8 min) were acquired
      using 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo and spin-echo echo-planar
      diffusion-weighted pulse sequences, respectively. \n\n\n### 2.3. Image Processing
      \n  \nThe high-resolution T1-weighted imaging and DTI data were transferred
      to a standalone workstation for imaging statistics. In VBM analysis, T1-weighted
      images were analyzed using the CAT12 (Computational Analysis Tool version 12,  ,
      accessed on 5 June 2022) toolbox. The preprocessing steps of the analysis were
      field bias modulation, tissue segmentation, diffeomorphic anatomical registration
      through exponentiated lie algebra-based spatial normalization [ ], and spatial
      smoothing. In this study, default parameters and the East Asian brain template
      were used in the image preprocessing. Afterwards, the normalized and segmented
      GM images were statistically compared between the groups on a voxel-by-voxel
      basis. \n\nIn voxel-wise DTI analysis, the image data were firstly corrected
      for the motion and eddy-current distortion using rigid-body and affine registrations,
      respectively, run in FSL (FMRIB Software Library, Oxford, UK). Second, the brain
      parenchyma was extracted using a brain extraction tool based on b0 images. Third,
      DTI data were then analyzed to obtain fractional anisotropy (FA), axial (AD),
      radial (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD) using the DTIFIT (FSL, FMRIB, Oxford,
      UK) tool. FA is an indicator of tissue integrity. AD and RD are the diffusivity
      in directions parallel and perpendicular to the axons, respectively. MD is the
      averaged diffusivity of a tensor. Fourth, the FA maps were spatially normalized
      to a standard coordinate defined by an international consortium for brain mapping-FA
      template. The normalization was carried out using both linear affine and non-linear
      demon image registrations, and the corresponding AD, RD, and MD maps were spatially
      normalized. Finally, the voxel-wise analysis was carried out using the SPM12
      toolbox (Statistical Parametric Mapping version 12,  , accessed on 5 June 2022).
      \n\n\n### 2.4. Statistical Analysis \n  \nFor psychological assessments, one-way
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine whether there was a
      significant difference between two groups. The differences were considered significant
      if corrected   p   < 0.05 with Bonferroni correction. For both VBM and DTI analyses,
      a voxel-wise two-sample   t  -test was performed to understand the difference
      of GM volumes and DTI indices between the groups with age as a covariate, and
      the differences were statistically significant if uncorrected   p   < 0.001
      and cluster > 100 voxels. Moreover, in significant regions, a Pearsons correlation
      analysis was performed to understand the relationship between the structural
      changes and the scores in each group. The correlation was considered significant
      if   p   < 0.05. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \nOne-way ANOVA analysis revealed
      that, in psychological assessments, only the AUDIT scores were significantly
      different among the groups, but no significant AUDIT differences were noted
      between two groups after Bonferroni correction, as shown in  . Besides, the
      HC group had significantly higher education levels than other subgroups. \n\nIn
      VBM analysis, the results showed that the offenders (VA, VP, and NV) had significantly
      greater GM volumes than the HC group in the right superior temporal gyrus. The
      sub-group comparisons further revealed that only the NV group had significantly
      greater GM volumes than the HC group in the right superior temporal gyrus, but
      the VA and VP groups did not exhibit significant change in GM volume as compared
      to the HC group, as shown in  . In addition, the NV group had significantly
      greater GM volumes than the VP group in bilateral thalamus, whereas the VP group
      had significantly greater GM volumes than the VA group in the right middle frontal
      gyrus. However, no significant differences in GM volume were noted between VA
      and NV groups, as shown in  . The Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates
      of regions with significantly different GM volumes between VA, VP, NV, and HC
      groups are listed in  . No significant correlation was noted between GM volume
      and psychological scores in significant regions. \n\nIn DTI analysis, the results
      showed that the offenders (VA + NV + NV) had significantly increased AD, RD,
      and MD values than those of HC group. The sub-group comparisons further revealed
      that only the VP group exhibited significantly increased AD, RD, and MD values
      than the HC group in the right rectus gyrus, as shown in  . The MNI coordinates
      of regions with significantly different AD, RD, and MD values between VP and
      HC groups are listed in  . However, no significant correlation was noted between
      DTI indices and psychological scores in the significant region. \n\n\n## 4.
      Discussion \n  \nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate
      changes in brain GM, WM, and psychological characteristics in affective, predatory,
      and non-violent offenders. Different from previous studies [ , , , , , ], the
      present study demonstrated that, although non-violent offenders had slightly
      higher AUDIT scores than other groups, the psychological characteristics (AUDIT,
      DII, and BDHI scores) were not significantly different between two sub-groups
      after Bonferroni correction. In brain structures, the non-violent offenders
      had significantly increased GM volumes in the right superior temporal gyrus,
      and the predatory offenders had significantly increased diffusivity in the right
      rectus gyrus as compared to healthy subjects. Moreover, the non-violent offenders
      exhibited greater GM volumes than the predatory offenders in the bilateral thalamus,
      and the predatory offenders had greater GM volumes than affective offenders
      in the right middle frontal gyrus. These findings highlighted the different
      involvement of cerebral GM and WM tissues between the three groups. \n\nIn the
      predatory offenders, the DTI results demonstrated that the predatory offenders
      had significantly higher AD, RD, and MD values than healthy subjects in the
      right rectus gyrus. The rectus gyrus was previously shown to be associated with
      depression [ ], aggression (irritability and hostility) [ ], and attention-deficit/hyperactivity
      disorders [ ]. It is known that the increased diffusivity may indicate that
      the extra-cellular space was increased likely due to partial axonal loss or
      vasogenic edema. Therefore, the predatory offenders may have altered right rectus
      gyrus function due to axonal degeneration, thus indicating possible impact on
      depression, aggression, attention, and hyperactivity behaviors. Further investigation
      will be needed to show the relationship between these behavioral characteristics
      and brain structural changes in violent subjects. In the non-violent offenders,
      although the VBM analysis demonstrated that all of the offenders (VA, VP, and
      NV) exhibited increased GM volume in the right superior temporal gyrus than
      healthy subjects, the sub-group comparison revealed that only non-violent offenders
      had significantly greater GM volumes than healthy subjects in the gyrus. The
      superior temporal gyrus was shown to be involved in the perception of emotions
      in facial stimuli, language, auditory processing, and social cognition processes
      [ , ]. Therefore, the finding of increased GM volume in the right superior temporal
      gyrus suggests that the non-violent offenders may exhibit altered functions
      involved in facial stimuli, language, auditory processing, and social cognition.  \n\nIn
      addition, the affective offenders exhibited a significantly smaller GM volume
      than the predatory offenders in the right middle frontal gyrus, suggesting that
      the affective offenders exhibited functions of emotion, attention, and memory
      different from those in the predatory offenders. The non-violent offenders had
      greater GM volumes than predatory offenders in the bilateral thalamus. It is
      known that the thalamus plays an important role in sensory, motor, attention,
      cognition, and memory functions. The findings may indicate that the predatory
      offenders exhibited more deteriorations in sensory, motor, cognition, and memory
      functions than those of the non-violent offenders.  \n\nMoreover, some previous
      studies demonstrated increased GM volumes in both cortical and subcortical regions
      [ , ], but others showed reduced GM volumes [ , , , , ]. One previous study
      further reported no significant changes in violent offenders as compared to
      healthy subjects [ ]. Differently, the present study demonstrated that the non-violent
      offenders exhibited increased GM volumes, and the affective and predatory offenders
      did not have significant alterations of GM volume as compared to healthy subjects.
      The inconsistent GM volume changes between the previous and present studies
      were likely attributable to the characteristics of enrolled violent subjects,
      as well as grouping strategy. Specifically, the smaller GM volume of the right
      middle frontal gyrus in the affective offenders than the predatory offenders
      further supports the hypothesis that emotional, unplanned impulsive murderers
      were less able to regulate and control aggressive impulses due to deficient
      prefrontal regulation, whereas predatory offenders have more prefrontal capacity
      to regulate and control these impulses [ , ]. Our preliminary findings may shed
      a light on the understanding of brain structural differences between the affective
      and predatory offenders.  \n\nThere are some limitations to the present study
      that warrant discussion. First, a small sample size may lead to a low statistical
      power. A study enrolling more violent subjects will be needed to provide more
      comprehensive results. Second, this study only enrolled male subjects. Therefore,
      these results do not reflect brain changes in female subjects. Third, the present
      study did not evaluate cognitive functions of the enrolled subjects, so the
      difference of cognitive functions between the violent subjects could not be
      confirmed. Fourth, the education levels of healthy subjects were higher than
      the offenders, so the results may have been affected by the education difference
      between the offenders and healthy subjects. Finally, in DTI analysis, the through-plane
      resolution (slice thickness) was relatively lower than the in-plane resolution;
      hence, the results of DTI analysis may be affected by the partial volume averaging
      in the through-plane direction. In addition, the DTI was acquired with echo-planar
      imaging pulse sequence, and likely suffered from susceptibility distortions.
      Thus, the results of the present study might be influenced by the susceptibility
      distortions. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nThis study performed both VBM and
      DTI analyses to understand the changes in GM volume and WM diffusion, and psychological
      characteristics in violent offenders. Our results demonstrated that the predatory
      and non-violent offenders exhibited significant changes in WM diffusion and
      GM volume in the rectus and superior temporal gyrus, respectively. Moreover,
      the predatory offenders had greater GM volumes than affective offenders in the
      right middle frontal gyrus, and that the non-violent offenders exhibited greater
      GM volumes than predatory offenders in the bilateral thalamus. Therefore, we
      concluded that the affective, predatory, and non-violent offenders exhibited
      different patterns of alterations in GM and WM tissues in regions involved in
      emotion and cognition. \n\n \n```", "role": "user"}], "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview",

      neuroimaging is a quickly developing field that still faces important methodological
      challenges. Pediatric images usually have more motion artifact than adult images.
      The artifact can cause visible errors in brain segmentation, and one way to
      address it is to manually edit the segmented images. Variability in editing
      and quality control protocols may complicate comparisons between studies. In
      this article, we describe in detail the semiautomated segmentation and quality
      control protocol of structural brain images that was used in FinnBrain Birth
      Cohort Study and relies on the well-established FreeSurfer v6.0 and ENIGMA (Enhancing
      Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta Analysis) consortium tools. The participants
      were typically developing 5-year-olds [  n   = 134, 5.34 (SD 0.06) years, 62
      girls]. Following a dichotomous quality rating scale for inclusion and exclusion
      of images, we explored the quality on a region of interest level to exclude
      all regions with major segmentation errors. The effects of manual edits on cortical
      thickness values were relatively minor: less than 2% in all regions. Supplementary
      Material cover registration and additional edit options in FreeSurfer and comparison
      to the computational anatomy toolbox (CAT12). Overall, we conclude that despite
      minor imperfections FreeSurfer can be reliably used to segment cortical metrics
      from T1-weighted images of 5-year-old children with appropriate quality assessment
      in place. However, custom templates may be needed to optimize the results for
      the subcortical areas. Through visual assessment on a level of individual regions
      of interest, our semiautomated segmentation protocol is hopefully helpful for
      investigators working with similar data sets, and for ensuring high quality
      pediatric neuroimaging data. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThere are
      multiple methodological challenges in pediatric neuroimaging studies that may
      affect quality of data and comparisons between studies. Magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) requires the subject to lie still while awake, which is more of a challenge
      with children than with adults ( ;  ;  ). This can lead to increased motion
      artifact. One study,   found that mild, moderate, and severe motion artifact
      were associated with 4, 7, and 27% loss of total gray matter (GM) volume in
      segmentation, respectively. Furthermore, subtle motion can cause bias even when
      a visible artifact is absent ( ). Another core challenge is the variation in
      preprocessing and segmentation techniques ( ), due to a lack of a gold standard
      processing pipeline for pediatric brain images. Therefore, some studies rightfully
      emphasize the importance of a validated quality control protocol ( ). \n\nFreeSurfer  is
      an open source software suite for processing brain MRI images that is commonly
      used in pediatric neuroimaging ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The
      automated FreeSurfer segmentation protocol utilizes surface-based parcellation
      of cortical regions based on cortical folding patterns and   a priori   knowledge
      of anatomical structures (further technical information in  ;  ). The FreeSurfer
      instructions recommend to visually check and, when necessary, manually edit
      the data. The manual edits can fix errors in the automated segmentation such
      as skull-stripping, white matter (WM), or pial errors (errors in the outer border
      of cortical GM). The FreeSurfer instructions suggest that this process takes
      approximately 30 min. However, in our experience, this timeframe seems far too
      short for careful quality assessment and editing. \n\nThe time requirement is
      perhaps the most important practical challenge in manual editing of brain images.
      Another one is the fact that the edits may lead to inter- and intra-rater bias.
      Nevertheless, effects of motion artifact must be considered in the segmentation
      process ( ), as some systematic errors in pial border, subcortical structures,
      and the cerebellum have been observed in structural brain images of 5-year-olds
      without manual edits ( ). While a visual check for major errors has obvious
      benefits, the benefits of manual edits are not as clear in children ( ), adolescents
      ( ), or adults ( ;  ;  ) as errors that can be manually edited are often small
      and therefore only have minor effects on cortical thickness (CT), surface area
      (SA), or volume values. Consequently, they do not necessarily affect the significant
      findings in group comparisons ( ;  ) or brainbehavior relationships ( ). However,
      we argue that systematic manual edits of the segmented images can help with
      quality control as they simultaneously maximize the chance to find segmentation
      errors that can be subsequently fixed. \n\nQuality control is often done by
      applying a dichotomous pass or fail scale: either by simply excluding the cases
      with excessive motion artifact ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ), excluding issues related
      to pathologies ( ;  ), excluding extreme outlier cases ( ), or it is simply
      noting that all images were considered to be of sufficient quality without a
      more detailed description of the criteria ( ). Another approach is to rate the
      image on a Likert scale from excellent or no motion artifact to unusable ( ;  ).
      One key challenge with this approach is that the exact borders between categories
      are very difficult to describe accurately in writing, and terms such as subtle
      and significant concentric bands or motion artifact are frequently used to draw
      the borders ( ;  ). Consequently, even if good intra- and inter-rater reliability
      can be reached within a study ( ), there can be large differences in how different
      studies define the categories. In many cases, the line of exclusion is drawn
      between moderate and severe ( ) or mild and moderate artifact ( ), and either
      way this fundamentally results in two categories: images with acceptable quality
      and images with unacceptable quality. Instead of a further quality classification
      via a Likert scale based on the amount of visible artifact, it might be beneficial
      to quality check all regions of interest (ROI) separately to verify high quality
      of the data. Especially considering the fact that the developing brain undergoes
      multiple non-linear growth patterns ( ;  ), which may cause issues when utilizing
      an adult template ( ;  ;  ), and local errors related to this challenge may
      be missed if quality check is based solely on the severity of visible motion
      artifact. \n\nIn this article, we propose a dichotomous rating scale for inclusion
      and exclusion of the images segmented with FreeSurfer, combined with a post-processing
      quality control protocol to visually confirm high quality data on a ROI level.
      For the automated segmentation tool in this protocol, we chose FreeSurfer based
      on the following practical advantages: (1) FreeSurfer has been validated for
      use in children between ages 4 and 11 years ( ), and multiple studies have used
      FreeSurfer to find brain associations between brain structure and risk factors
      or cognitive differences in children ( ;  ;  ); (2) FreeSurfer provides a method
      to accurately assess image quality and to fix certain types of errors via Freeview;
      and (3) Rigorous quality control protocols, such as the one provided by the
      ENIGMA consortium (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta Analysis ),
      already exist for FreeSurfer to make final quality assessment on such a level
      that allows the researchers to exclude single ROIs with imperfect segmentation.
      We decided to use the ENIGMA quality control protocol, as it is widely used
      and accepted ( ), and has been successfully implemented for both adults ( )
      and children ( ;  ). The manual edits instructed by FreeSurfer and rigorous
      ENIGMA quality control protocol were combined to form the semiautomated segmentation
      protocol used in the FinnBrain Neuroimaging Lab. \n\nIn the current study, we
      used a subsample of circa 5-year-olds that participated in MRI brain scans as
      part of the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study. We give a detailed description of
      our manual editing and quality control protocol for T1-weighted MRI images in
      the FreeSurfer software suite. We used the ENIGMA quality control protocol and
      compare the findings to our protocol. This article aims to make our protocol
      very explicit and provide some guidelines on how one might assess image quality
      in a systematic manner across the sample (similar to  ). Furthermore, in a complementary
      analysis, we compared automated segmentation results between FreeSurfer and
      the statistical parametric mapping (SPM ) based computational anatomy toolbox
      (CAT12 ) to assess to the level of agreement. Finally, we compared the standard
      recon-all to other optional flags in FreeSurfer. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods
      \n  \nThis study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki,
      and it was approved by the Joint Ethics Committee of the University of Turku
      and the Hospital District of Southwest Finland (07.08.2018) 330, ETMK: 31/180/2011.
      \n\n### Participants \n  \nThe participants are part of the FinnBrain Birth
      Cohort Study  ( ), where 5-year-olds were invited to neuropsychological, logopedic,
      neuroimaging, and pediatric study visits. For the neuroimaging visit, we primarily
      recruited participants that had a prior visit to neuropsychological measurements
      at circa 5 years of age (  n   = 141/146). However, there were a few exceptions:
      three participants were included without a neuropsychological visit, as they
      had an exposure to maternal prenatal synthetic glucocorticoid treatment (recruited
      separately for a nested casecontrol sub-study). The data additionally includes
      two participants that were enrolled for pilot scans. We aimed to scan all subjects
      between the ages 5 years 3 months and 5 years 5 months, and 135/146 (92%) of
      the participants attended the visit within this timeframe (reasons to scan outside
      the timeframe include, for example, the family moving the visit to a later date).
      The exclusion criteria for this study were: (1) born before gestational week
      35 (before gestational week 32 for those with exposure to maternal prenatal
      synthetic glucocorticoid treatment), (2) developmental anomaly or abnormalities
      in senses or communication (e.g., blindness, deafness, and congenital heart
      disease), (3) known long-term medical diagnosis (e.g., epilepsy and autism),
      (4) ongoing medical examinations or clinical follow up in a hospital (meaning
      there has been a referral from primary care setting to special health care),
      (5) child use of continuous, daily medication (including per oral medications,
      topical creams, and inhalants. One exception to this was desmopressin ( Minirin)
      medication, which was allowed), (6) history of head trauma (defined as concussion
      necessitating clinical follow up in a health care setting or worse), (7) metallic
      (golden) ear tubes (to assure good-quality scans), and routine MRI contraindications.
      \n\nIn the current study, we used a subsample (approximately two thirds of the
      full sample) that consists of the participants that were scanned before a temporary
      stop to visits due to the restrictions caused by the coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) pandemic. The scans were performed between 29 October, 2017 and 1
      March, 2020. We contacted 415 families and reached 363 (87%) of them. In total,
      146 (40% of the reached families) participants attended imaging visits (one
      pair of twins, one participant attended twice, and only the latter scan was
      included). Eight of them did not start the scan, and four were excluded due
      to excess motion artifact in the T1-image. Thereafter, 134 T1 images (mean age
      5.34 years, SD 0.06 years, range 5.085.22 years, 72 boys, 62 girls) entered
      the processing pipelines.   presents the demographic data as recommended in
      our earlier review ( ). A flowchart depicting the formation of the final sample
      through the different exclusion steps is presented in  . \n  \nA flowchart depicting
      the steps leading to our final sample size of 121. The region of interest (ROI)
      exclusions are presented in  . \n  \n\n### The Study Visits \n  \nAll MRI scans
      were performed for research purposes by the research staff (one research nurse,
      four Ph.D. students, and two MR technologists). Before the visit, each family
      was personally contacted and recruited via telephone calls by a research staff
      member. The scan preparations started with the recruitment and at home training.
      We introduced the image acquisition process to the parents and advised them
      to explain the process to their children and confirm child assent before the
      follow up phone call that was used to confirm the willingness to participate.
      Thereafter, we advised the parents to use at home familiarization methods such
      as showing a video describing the visit, playing audio of scanner sounds, encouraging
      the child to lie still like a statue (statue game), and practicing with a homemade
      mock scanner, e.g., a cardboard box with a hole to view a movie through. The
      visit was marketed to the participants as a space adventure, which is in principle
      similar to the previously described submarine protocol ( ) but the child was
      allowed to come up with other settings as well. A member of the research staff
      made a home visit before the scan to deliver earplugs and headphones, to give
      more detailed information about the visit, and to answer any remaining questions.
      An added benefit of the home visit was the chance to meet the participating
      child and that way start the familiarization with the research staff. \n\nAt
      the start of the visit, we familiarized the participant with the research team
      (research nurse and a medically trained Ph.D. student) and acquired written
      informed consent from both parents. This first portion of the visit included
      a practice session using a non-commercial mock scanner consisting of a toy tunnel
      and a homemade wooden head coil. Inexpensive non-commercial mock scanners have
      been shown to be as effective as commercial ones ( ). The participants brought
      at least one of their toys that would undergo a mock scan (e.g., an MRI compatible
      stuffed animal they could also bring with them into the real scanner). The researcher
      played scanner sounds on their cell phone during the mock scan and the child
      could take pictures of the toy lying still and of the toy being moved by the
      researcher to demonstrate the importance of lying still during the scan. Communication
      during the scan was practiced. Overall, these preparations at the scan site
      were highly variable as we did our best to accommodate to befit the child characteristics
      (e.g., taking into account the physical activity and anxiety) in cooperation
      with the family. Finally, we served a light meal of the participants choice
      before the scan. \n\nThe participants were scanned awake or during natural sleep.
      One member of the research staff and parent(s) stayed in the scanner room throughout
      the whole scan. During the scan, participants wore earplugs and headphones.
      Through the headphones, they were able to listen to the movie or TV show of
      their choice while watching it with the help of mirrors fitted into the head
      coil (the TV was located at the foot of the bed of the scanner). Some foam padding
      was applied to help the head stay still and assure comfortable position. Participants
      were given a signal ball to throw in case they needed or wanted to stop or pause
      the scan (e.g., to visit the toilet). If the research staff member noticed movement,
      they gently reminded the participant to stay still by lightly touching their
      foot. This method of communication was agreed on earlier in the visit and was
      planned to convey a clear signal of presence while minimizing the tactile stimulation.
      Many of the methods used to reduce anxiety and motion during the scan have been
      described in earlier studies ( ;  ). \n\nAll images were viewed by one neuroradiologist
      (RP) who then consulted a pediatric neurologist (TL) when necessary. There were
      four (out of 146, 2.7%) cases with an incidental finding that required consultation.
      All four cases initially entered the FreeSurfer processing pipeline and three
      were included in the final ROI based analyses. The protocol with incidental
      findings has been described in our earlier work ( ), and a separate report of
      their incidence is in preparation for the eventual full data set. \n\n\n###
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data Acquisition \n  \nParticipants were scanned
      using a Siemens Magnetom Skyra fit 3T with a 20-element head/neck matrix coil.
      We used Generalized Autocalibrating Partially Parallel Acquisition (GRAPPA)
      technique to accelerate image acquisition [parallel acquisition technique (PAT)
      factor of 2 was used]. The MRI data was acquired as a part of max. 60-min scan
      protocol. The scans included a high resolution T1 magnetization prepared rapid
      gradient echo (MPRAGE), a T2 turbo spin echo (TSE), a 7-min resting state functional
      MRI, and a 96-direction single shell (b = 1,000 s/mm ) diffusion tensor imaging
      (DTI) sequence ( ) as well as a 31-direction with b = 650 s/mm  and a 80-direction
      with b = 2,000 s/mm . For the purposes of the current study, we acquired high
      resolution T1-weighted images with the following sequence parameters: repetition
      time (TR) = 1,900 ms, echo time (TE) = 3.26 ms, inversion time (TI) = 900 ms,
      flip angle = 9 degrees, voxel size = 1.0  1.0  1.0 mm , and field of view (FOV)
      256  256 mm . The scans were planned as per recommendations of the FreeSurfer
      developers. \n\n\n### Data Processing \n  \n#### FreeSurfer \n  \nCortical reconstruction
      and volumetric segmentation for all 134 images were performed with the FreeSurfer
      software suite, version 6.0.0.  We selected the T1 image with the least motion
      artifact (in case there were several attempts due to visible motion during scan)
      and then applied the recon-all processing stream with default parameters. It
      begins with transformation to Talaraich space, intensity inhomogeneity correction,
      bias field correction ( ), and skull-stripping ( ). Thereafter, WM is separated
      from GM and other tissues and the volume within the created WMGM boundary is
      filled. After this, the surface is tessellated and smoothed. After these preprocessing
      steps are completed, the surface is inflated ( ) and registered to a spherical
      atlas. This method adapts to the folding pattern of each individual brain, utilizing
      consistent folding patterns such as the central sulcus and the sylvian fissure
      as landmarks, allowing for high localization accuracy ( ). FreeSurfer uses probabilistic
      approach based on Markov random fields for automated labeling of brain regions.
      Cortical thickness is calculated as the average distance between the WMGM boundary
      and the pial surface on the tessellated surface ( ). The cortical thickness
      measurement technique has been validated against post-mortem histological (
      ) and manual measurements ( ;  ). \n\n\n#### FreeSurfer Manual Edits and the
      Freeview Quality Control Protocol \n  \nWe used Freeview to view and edit the
      images using the standard command recommended by the FreeSurfer instructions
      with the addition of the DesikanKilliany atlas that allowed us to correctly
      identify the ROIs where errors were found. Images with excess motion artifact
      or large unsegmented regions (extending over multiple gyri, examples provided
      in  ) were excluded. There were 13 participants that were excluded due to erroneous
      segmentation. The images that passed the initial quality check were then manually
      edited (the time required for manual editing ranged from 45 min in high quality
      images to over 3 h in images with a lot of artifact, taking approximately 2
      h on average). All images were examined in all three directions one hemisphere
      at a time and the edits were made for every slice regardless of the ROI in question.
      Subsequently, we ran the automated segmentation process again as suggested by
      FreeSurfer instructions. The images were then inspected again for errors, and
      the ROIs with errors that affect WMGM or pial borders were excluded in the Freeview
      quality control protocol. The Freeview protocol presented in this study was
      adapted locally for the FinnBrain Neuroimaging Lab as a method to assess errors
      in a slice-by-slice view from the official quality control procedure provided
      in the FreeSurfer instructions.  We also provide a practical application manual
      in   ( , pages 39, FreeSurfer editing) that we give to new researchers when
      they start practicing the FinnBrain manual editing and quality control protocol.
      \n\n##### Errors in Borders \n  \nThe automatically segmented images generated
      by FreeSurfer software suite were visually inspected and the found errors were
      either manually corrected or the ROI with the error was simply excluded depending
      on the type of error. Excess parts of the skull were removed where the pial
      border was affected by them ( ). Arteries were removed to avoid segmentation
      errors between arteries and WM (especially relevant for anterior temporal areas
      and the insulae). This was done by setting the eraser to only delete voxels
      with intensity between 130 and 190 in the brainmask volume. The arteries were
      removed throughout the image with no regard to whether they caused issues in
      the segmentation on that specific slice. An example can be seen in  . In cases
      where an error appeared in a junction between ROIs, all adjoining ROIs were
      excluded. \n  \nA presentation of some common errors and fixes related to the
      pial border and non-brain tissues.   (A)   Demonstrates how skull fragments
      can cause errors in pial border (yellow circles).   (B)   Presents the same
      subject with skull fragments removed. In panel   (C)  , arteries were removed
      (green circle). We removed voxels with an intensity between 130 and 190, and
      therefore some parts of arteries were not removed (yellow circle).   (C)   Also
      demonstrates the challenges with artifact, meninges, and the pial border. In
      some areas, the pial border may extend into the meninges (yellow arrows). Meanwhile,
      at the other end of the same gyrus, the border may seem correct (green arrows).
      It is difficult to fix these errors manually. Additionally, the visible motion
      artifact adds further challenges to manual edits of the pial border. In panel   (D)  ,
      the pial border cuts through a gyrus. \n  \nOne typical error was that parts
      of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) were included within the pial border. We
      stopped editing the SSS after an interim assessment as it was an arduous task
      with little effect on final results. All information regarding SSS edits is
      presented in   ( , pages 1014, Superior sagittal sinus). \n\nIn addition, there
      were errors that could not be fixed easily. In some cases, the pial border may
      cut through the cortex (  shows an error in the left rostral middle frontal
      region). In these cases, the remaining GM mask is too small, and this error
      cannot be easily fixed in Freeview. Manual segmentation of a T1 image is labor
      intensive and hard to conduct reliably with 1 mm  resolution even when the edits
      would cover small areas. Moreover, the FreeSurfer instructions do not recommend
      this approach. Additionally, the WM mask edits recommended in FreeSurfer instructions
      would not fix all cases where the cortical segmentation is too thin, as the
      WM mask often seemed adequate in these areas (an example presented in  ). Therefore,
      we simply had to exclude the ROI(s) in question. \n\nSmall errors of the WMGM
      border were prevalent throughout the brain. The corrections were made by erasing
      excess WM mask. This process is demonstrated in  . WMGM border was inspected
      after the manual edits. A continuous error of at least ten slices in the coronal
      view led to exclusion of all the ROIs directly impacted by the error. Furthermore,
      ubiquitous errors in the WMGM border, as markers of motion artifact, led to
      exclusion of the whole brain (as in  ). \n  \nA demonstration of our white matter
      (WM) mask editing protocol.   (A)   Shows a typical error in the border between
      white and gray matter (WMGM border), where it extends too close to the pial
      border. Errors such as this are searched for in the brainmask volume   (A,D)  .   (B)   Shows
      the same error in wm volume with Jet colormap   (B,C)  .   (C)   Shows how we
      fixed these errors by erasing the erroneous WM mask (blue voxels).   (D)   Shows
      the final result after the second recon-all. \n    \nTwo examples of excluded
      brain images.   (A)   Shows waves throughout the image, marking motion artifact.   (B)   Shows
      the same subject as in panel   (A)   in a coronal view and borders visible.
      This image shows motion artifact related errors in the border between white
      and gray matter (WMGM border), denoted by the yellow circle. Additionally, there
      is potential unsegmented area due to motion artifact (green circle) and poor
      contrast between WM and GM (white circle).   (C,D)   Show another excluded subject.
      The motion artifact in panel   (C)   is not as pronounced as in panel   (A)  .
      However,   (D)   still shows some typical errors for images with much artifact.
      There is a clear pial error (white arrow). Additionally, the yellow arrows show
      typical cases, where the ringing causes the WM mask to widen where the actual
      WM meets the ringing motion artifact. \n  \nFurthermore, there are some error
      types that cannot be easily fixed but also do not warrant exclusion. One such
      problem is that the pial border often extends into the cerebrospinal fluid or
      meninges around the brain ( ). The issue with this type of error is that sometimes
      the real border between GM and the surrounding meninges cannot be denoted visually
      and therefore the error cannot be reliably fixed. This problem is further complicated
      by the fact that motion artifact may mimic the border between GM and meninges
      making the visual quality control challenging (  and  ). In addition to motion,
      fat shift can also cause this type of artifact. The amount of fat shift in images
      is dependent on the imaging protocol, more specifically the bandwidth of the
      acquisition. \n\nThere were some minor incongruities in multiple images. A common
      example can be seen in  , where there seems to be a potential error in the pial
      border. Areas like this look normal in other planes. A less common example is
      shown in  , where there is an apparent discontinuation in the WMGM border. Similarly,
      there was no discontinuation in other planes. Both these minor incongruities
      were considered partial volume effects related to the presentation of a 3D surface
      in 2D slices. Therefore, both cases were included. \n\n\n##### Errors in Cortical
      Labeling \n  \nA common issue was the presence of WM hypointensities in the
      segmented images. They sometimes erroneously appeared in the cortex. These errors
      were typically small and did not cause errors in pial or WMGM borders ( ), and
      in those cases did not require exclusion. The hypointensities themselves were
      rarely successfully fixed by editing the WM mask and therefore were left unedited
      unless they caused errors in the GMWM border. In those cases, removing the WM
      mask fairly often fixed the error in the border, although frequently the incorrect
      hypointensity label still remained in the WM segmentation. We tried to fix the
      errors in the WMGM border and when unsuccessful, we simply excluded the ROI
      in question from analyses ( ). Of note, these errors can only be seen with the
      anatomical labels as overlays, unless they affect the WMGM border. \n  \n (A,B)   Show
      a white matter (WM) hypointensity that affects the border between white and
      gray matter (WMGM border), denoted by a yellow circle.   (C,D)   Show how the
      posterior part of the lateral ventricle causes distortion to the WMGM border
      (yellow circle). If the error was not successfully fixed, all regions adjoining
      the error were excluded. \n  \nOne typical error occurred at the posterior end
      of the lateral ventricles, where it may cause segmentation errors in the adjacent
      cortical regions, typically the precuneus and the lingual gyrus. These regions
      were excluded from analyses when there was a distortion in the GMWM border (
      ), and included when there was no distortion in the border ( ). Unfortunately,
      hypointensities often appeared in ROI junctions, leading to exclusion of multiple
      regions due to one error ( ). Similar errors were seen in the ENIGMA protocol
      as well ( ). \n\n\n##### Errors in Subcortical Labeling \n  \nPutamen was often
      mislabeled by FreeSurfer in our sample. Errors were addressed by adding control
      points, but the edits were largely unsuccessful. Consequently, we are currently
      working on separately validating subcortical segmentation procedures for our
      data ( ). All information regarding the subcortical labeling is presented in   (
      , pages 1516, Subcortex). \n\n\n\n#### ENIGMA Quality Control Protocol \n  \nAfter
      the quality control that entailed manual edits, we conducted a quality check
      with the ENIGMA Cortical Quality Control Protocol 2.0 (April 2017).  Therein,
      the FreeSurfer cortical surface measures were extracted and screened for statistical
      outliers using R  and visualized via Matlab (Mathworks) and bash scripts. Visual
      representations of the external 3D surface and internal 2D slices were generated
      and visually inspected according to the instructions provided by ENIGMA in   (at
      the time of writing). The ENIGMA Cortical quality check instructions remark
      how certain areas have a lot of anatomical variation and therefore they note
      the possibility to be more or less stringent in their quality control. Considering
      this and the fact that the example images provided in the ENIGMA instructions
      are limited in number and as such cannot show every variation, we deemed necessary
      to describe how we implemented these instructions in our sample. \n\n##### The
      External View \n  \nWe started by viewing the external image. The pre- and postcentral
      gyri were assessed for meninge overestimations, which can manifest as spikes
      ( ) or flat areas ( ). These error types were rare in our sample. These cases
      were excluded as instructed. \n\nThe supramarginal gyrus has a lot of anatomical
      variability and when quality checking it, we decided to be lenient as suggested
      by the ENIGMA instructions. We only excluded cases where the border between
      supramarginal and inferior parietal regions cuts through a gyrus, leading to
      discontinuous segments in one of the regions ( ). In some rare cases, this type
      of error also happened with the postcentral gyrus ( ), and these cases were
      also excluded. Similarly, in cases with supramarginal gyrus overestimation into
      the superior temporal gyrus, we only excluded clear errors (examples presented
      in  ). \n  \n (A)   Shows an error (yellow circle) where the inferior parietal
      area (purple) cuts through a whole gyrus in the supramarginal region (green).
      This area has a lot of variation and only clear errors led to exclusion in our
      ENIGMA quality control protocol.   (B)   Shows insula overestimation in the
      midline (green circle). Furthermore, the poor image quality can be seen the
      areas adjacent to the base of the skull, such as parahippocampal (green area
      denoted by a red arrow) and entorhinal (red area denoted be a white arrow).
      Additionally, there is an error in the border between superior frontal and caudal
      anterior cingulate. This border should follow the sulcal line. The rostral anterior
      cingulate was not considered erroneous in these cases. \n  \nOne commonly seen
      error is insula overestimation into the midline ( ). In these cases, we exclude
      insula and the region(s) adjacent to it in the midline (e.g., the medial orbitofrontal
      region in the case of  ). \n\nThe border between the superior frontal region
      and the cingulate cortex (  and  ) is one typical place for errors. A prominent
      paracingulate sulcus, that is more common on the left than on the right hemisphere,
      may cause underestimation of the cingulate cortex and consequently overestimation
      of the superior frontal region. This was typically seen on the left caudal anterior
      cingulate ( ), where we excluded the cases where the border did not follow sulcal
      lines anteriorly (as was demonstrated in the image examples in the instructions).
      In rare cases the border between posterior cingulate and superior frontal region
      was affected ( ), and these were also excluded. \n\nThe pericalcarine region
      was overestimated in some cases. According to the instructions cases where the
      segmentation is confined to the calcarine sulcus should be accepted. Therefore,
      we excluded cases where the pericalcarine region extended over a whole gyrus
      into the lingual gyrus or the cuneus. An example can be seen in  . \n\nCases
      of superior parietal overestimation were excluded as instructed. These errors
      were rare in our sample. Similarly, errors in the banks of the superior temporal
      sulcus were excluded as instructed. \n\nThe border between the middle and inferior
      temporal gyrus was not assessed, as the instructions suggested that most irregularities
      seen there are normal variants or relate to the viewing angle. \n\nSimilarly,
      we did not quality check the entorhinal/parahippocampal regions in the external
      view, as there is a lot of variation in the area. The ENIGMA instructions describe
      underestimations in 7080% of cases. Furthermore, this region looks poor in practically
      all images (e.g., in  ) as do all the regions adjacent to the base of the skull
      and therefore, in our opinion, the quality assessment in those regions requires
      additional procedures, that are beyond the scope of the current study, to confirm
      their usability in statistical analyses. \n\n\n##### The Internal View \n  \nIn
      the internal view, regions with unsegmented GM were excluded. These errors often
      reflect WM hypointensities seen in Freeview ( ). Interestingly, even quite large
      hypointensities do not necessarily equate to errors in the borders set by FreeSurfer
      and therefore do not always have an adverse effect on CT calculations. \n\nTemporal
      pole underestimations were sometimes seen. However, the cases were rarely as
      clear as presented in the instructions. Therefore, we had to use both coronal
      and axial views to assess the situation and make exclusions when both views
      supported an error in segmentation. \n\nOne of the errors commonly seen in our
      sample was the erroneous pial surface delineation in the lateral parts of the
      brain. This was particularly prevalent in the middle temporal gyri ( ). Notably,
      it is possible to attempt fixing these types of topological errors, e.g., by
      using control points or brainmask edits. Some previous studies (e.g.,  ) have
      done this. They reported average editing time of 9, 5 h, approximately quadruple
      our editing time, and concluded that the edits did not affect conclusions. Therefore,
      this type of edit was omitted as too time-consuming and challenging compared
      to the expected effect on results. The ROIs affected by these errors were excluded
      from analyses. This error was assessed from 2D slices, wherein what seems to
      be an error may be caused by partial volume effects. For example, in  , there
      seems to be a possible error on the right middle temporal region. If we look
      at the same image in Freeview, the same position seems to be segmented normally,
      especially when confirmed in the axial view ( ). Consequently, we only made
      exclusion when clear errors were seen in two adjacent slices. Particularly clear
      example of this can be seen in  , where the WM extends outside the segmentation.
      The error is also visible in the external view, where these regions do not appear
      as smooth as normally ( ), however the decisions to exclude a ROI were always
      made based on the internal view. This kind of error was significantly harder
      to recognize in Freeview and represents the most striking difference in results
      between the ENIGMA and Freeview quality control protocols. \n  \nThere are some
      visible errors in the lateral parts of the image (arrows). An especially clear
      error is denoted by the red circle, where some white matter is seen outside
      the cortical segmentation. \n  \n\n##### Statistical Outliers \n  \nAfter the
      systematic viewing of all the problem regions, we inspected the statistical
      outliers. This rarely led to new exclusions, as many of the statistical outliers
      were among the excluded subjects or the outliers were ROIs where the instructions
      did not give any tools to assess whether they were correct. Therefore, we had
      to simply double check the internal view to rule out segmentation errors. \n\n\n#####
      Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics Through Meta Analysis Exclusion Differences
      Between Edited and Unedited Images \n  \nWe performed the full ENIGMA quality
      control protocol for all edited images that were included in the ROI based analyses
      (  n   = 121). To assess how manual edits affect the number of excluded regions,
      we also performed the ENIGMA quality control protocol on a half sample (  n   =
      61) of unedited images. In borderline cases (mostly regarding the borders between
      the supramarginal and superior temporal gyri as well as between the caudal anterior
      cingulate and superior frontal gyri) we consulted the ENIGMA quality control
      protocol of the edited images, to make the same ruling if the error was similar.
      Likewise, in the cases where the edited image passed the internal or external
      view without any ROI exclusions, but did not pass in the unedited version, the
      images were directly compared to each other to ensure the reason for not passing
      is an objective difference, as opposed to a human error or a different ruling
      in a borderline case. \n\n\n\n#### Exclusions \n  \nWe decided to use a dichotomous
      rating scale: pass or fail. The amount of motion artifact (marked by concentric
      rings or waves) and the clarity of the WMGM border were assessed from the original
      T1 image. In borderline cases, we ran the standard recon-all and made new assessment
      based on the segmented image. Massive segmentation errors such as large missing
      areas or ubiquitous errors in WMGM border were reasons for exclusion. Additionally,
      ENIGMA exclusion criteria were implemented as instructed. In some borderline
      cases, another expert rater assessed the image quality and agreement was reached
      to either include or exclude the image. Some images that were considered for
      inclusion but excluded after the first recon-all can be seen in  . These images
      had significantly more artifact than other images in our sample, although arguably
      they could have been included since the amount of artifact could be described
      as moderate. However, we decided to implement strict exclusion criteria to ensure
      high quality of data. \n\n\n#### Alternate Processing: Optional Registration
      Flags in FreeSurfer \n  \nWe compared the FreeSurfer default recon all to recon-all
      with the -mprage and -schwartzya3t-atlas optional flags. All information regarding
      optional flags analyses is presented in   ( , pages 1718, Optional flags). \n\n\n####
      Alternate Processing: CAT12 \n  \nA previous study conducted in the elderly
      demonstrated good agreement between FreeSurfer and CAT12 estimates of CT (  R   =
      0.83), although CAT12 produced systematically higher values than FreeSurfer
      ( ). Therefore, we decided to explore the agreement between the two software
      in a pediatric population. All information regarding CAT12 analyses is presented
      in   ( , pages 1925, CAT12). \n\n\n\n### Alternate Quality Control: Qoala-T
      \n  \nQoala-T is a supervised learning tool for quality control of automated
      labeling processed in FreeSurfer, and it is particularly intended for use in
      analysis of pediatric datasets ( ). We compared Qoala-T scores from all 134
      participants that entered the FreeSurfer segmentation protocol, and the results
      are reported in   ( , pages 2629, Qoala-T). \n\n\n### Statistics \n  \nStatistical
      analyses were conducted using the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 25.0
      (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States). The ROI data was confirmed to be normally
      distributed using JMP Pro 15 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, United States) based
      on visual assessment and the similarity of mean and median values. \n\nTo compare
      the differences between the included (the participants that were included in
      ROI based analyses,   n   = 121) and excluded (all participants that lacked
      usable T1 data,   n   = 25) groups, we performed independent samples   t  -tests
      for age from birth at scan, gestational age at scan, gestational age at birth,
      birthweight, maternal age at term, and maternal body mass index (BMI) before
      pregnancy. In addition, we conducted Chi-Square tests for child gender, maternal
      education level (three classes: 1 = Upper secondary school or vocational school
      or lower, 2 = University of applied sciences, and 3 = University), maternal
      monthly income estimate after taxes (in euros, four classes: 1 = 1,500 or less,
      2 = 1,5012,500, 3 = 2,5013,500, and 4 = 3,501 or more), maternal alcohol use
      during pregnancy (1 = yes, continued to some degree after learning about the
      pregnancy, 2 = yes, stopped after learning about the pregnancy, and 3 = no),
      maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy (1 = yes, continued to some degree
      after learning about the pregnancy, 2 = yes, stopped after learning about the
      pregnancy, and 3 = no), maternal history of disease (allergies, depression,
      asthma, anxiety disorder, eating disorder, chronic urinary tract infection,
      autoimmune disorder, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension), and maternal medication
      use at gestational week 14 (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, thyroxin,
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI] or serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake
      inhibitor [SNRI], and corticosteroids), or at gestational week 34 (thyroxin,
      SSRI or SNRI, corticosteroids, and blood pressure medications). The categories
      in history of disease and medication during pregnancy were only included in
      statistical analyses, when there were at least four participants that had history
      of the disease or used the medication (to limit the chance of false positives).
      \n\nTo compare the exclusion rates between Freeview and ENIGMA quality control
      protocols, as well as between ENIGMA quality control protocols of edited and
      unedited images, we conducted Chi-Square tests (among all datapoints, single
      ROIs, and internal/external view passes in ENIGMA). \n\nThe inclusion criterion
      for the ROI based comparisons was passing the ENIGMA quality control protocol.
      To compare edited FreeSurfer to unedited FreeSurfer, we conducted a paired samples   t  -test.
      We calculated the absolute values of the change in CT between unedited and edited
      images for each ROI separately using the following formula: (C /C ) * 100%,
      where C  is the absolute value of the difference in mean CT between edited and
      unedited images and C  is the mean CT in the unedited images. Furthermore, we
      conducted a paired samples   t  -test with the mean CT values from all ROIs
      to measure the change between edited and unedited images. The same analyses
      were performed for WM SA and GM volume. \n\nTo assess the effects of manual
      editing and quality control on group comparison and brain structural asymmetry
      results, we conducted independent samples   t  -tests for sex differences in
      CT, SA, and volume measurements between a sample without quality control (  n   =
      121 for every ROI) and the quality-controlled sample (maximum   n   = 121, where
      number of included ROIs varies). Using these same samples, we also conducted
      paired samples   t  -tests for the 34 ROIs in both hemispheres to examine structural
      asymmetry.  ,   output was created using JASP 0.16.1 ( ). \n\nAll significances
      were calculated 2-tailed ( = 0.05). To adjust for multiple comparisons in ROI-based
      analyses, we conducted the Bonferroni correction by setting the   p   value
      to 0.05 divided by the number of comparisons (=the number of ROIs = 68), resulting
      in   p   = 0.000735. We notify that the   p   value cut off for the current
      study is somewhat arbitrary and thus we also report the raw   p   values in
      the tables. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographics \n  \nThere were no significant
      differences between the included and excluded subjects age from birth at scan,
      gestational age at scan, gestational age at birth, birth weight, maternal age
      at term, maternal education level, maternal monthly income, maternal history
      of disease, maternal alcohol use during pregnancy, or maternal tobacco smoking
      during pregnancy. There was a significant difference in maternal BMI before
      pregnancy (  p   = 0.03). In the included group, mean maternal BMI was 23.9
      (  n   = 121) vs. 26.0 in the excluded group (  n   = 24, information from one
      participant missing). Two types of medication were more common in the excluded
      group: SSRI or SNRI medication at 14 gestational weeks (  p   = 0.03; included
      group 109 no, 3 yes; excluded group 20 no, 3 yes) and blood pressure medication
      at 34 gestational weeks (  p   = 0.03; included group 113 no, 3 yes; excluded
      group 21 no, 3 yes). In addition, there was a marginally significant difference
      in SSRI/SNRI use at 34 gestational weeks (  p   = 0.06; included group 112 no,
      4 yes; excluded group 21 no, 3 yes). Of note, these results are not optimal
      to determine whether the listed early exposures are associated with poorer image
      quality as such but such comparisons may be useful to conduct before final analyses
      in any data set (and are also included for descriptive purposes) (please see
      related articles: A.  ; Alina  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n### Comparison Between
      Unedited and Manually Edited FreeSurfer Segmentations \n  \n#### Cortical Thickness
      \n  \nThe difference in CT was not significant after Bonferroni correction in
      57/68 (83.8%) regions. Unedited images had significantly larger CT values in
      2/68 (2.9%) regions: the right rostral anterior cingulate and right superior
      temporal regions. Edited images had significantly larger CT values in 9/68 (13.2%)
      regions: the left and right caudal middle frontal, left and right inferior temporal,
      left and right superior parietal, right precentral, right superior frontal,
      and right supramarginal regions. The smallest (both absolute and relative) change
      was observed in the left rostral middle frontal (0.0003 mm, 0.011%) and the
      largest (both absolute and relative) in the right caudal middle frontal (0.0526
      mm, 1.857%) region. The CT changes and raw   p  -values for all ROIs are presented
      in  . \n\nThe mean change in absolute CT values between the unedited and edited
      images was 0.0129 mm (0.441%). When we include the direction of the change in
      the analysis, edited images had higher CT values (mean 0.00264 mm, 0.0901%),
      although the difference was not statistically significant (  p   = 0.217). \n\nPearson
      correlations between edited and unedited images were calculated by ROI, they
      all were positive and ranged from 0.725 in the left insula to 0.984 in the left
      banks of the superior temporal sulcus region. All remained statistically significant
      after Bonferroni correction. The correlations are displayed in  . \n\n\n####
      Surface Area \n  \nThe difference in SA was not significant after Bonferroni
      correction in 57/68 (83.8%) regions. Unedited images had significantly larger
      SA in 11/68 (16.2%) regions: the left and right postcentral, left and right
      precentral, left and right superior parietal, left and right insula, left caudal
      middle frontal, left superior frontal, and right inferior temporal regions.
      There were no areas where edited images had significantly larger SA values.
      The smallest absolute change was observed in the right pars orbitalis (0.26
      mm , 0.028%) and the smallest relative change was seen in the right middle temporal
      gyrus (0.53 mm , 0.015%). The largest absolute change was observed in the right
      superior parietal region (161.05 mm , 2.55%) and the largest relative change
      was observed in the right insula (66,41 mm , 2.81%). The SA changes and raw   p  -values
      for all ROIs are presented in  . \n\nThe mean change in absolute SA values between
      the unedited and edited images was 21.21 mm  (0.778%). When we include the direction
      of the change in the analysis, edited images had lower SA values than unedited
      images (mean 17.52 mm , 0.643%) and the difference was statistically significant
      (  p   = 0.000044). \n\nPearson correlations between edited and unedited images
      were calculated by ROI, they all were positive and ranged from 0.669 in the
      left frontal pole to 0.995 in the left supramarginal region. All remained statistically
      significant after Bonferroni correction. The correlations are presented in  .
      \n\n\n#### Volume \n  \nThe difference in volume was not significant after Bonferroni
      correction in 66/68 (97.1%) regions. Unedited images had significantly larger
      volumes in 2/68 (2.9%) regions: the left and right insulae. There were no areas
      where edited images had significantly larger volume values. The smallest absolute
      change was observed in the left precuneus (0.83 mm , 0.020%) and the smallest
      relative change was seen in the right superior parietal region (3.58 mm , 0.019%).
      The largest (both absolute and relative) change was observed in the left insula
      (189.56 mm , 2.400%). The SA changes and raw   p  -values for all ROIs are presented
      in  . \n\nThe mean change in absolute volume values between the unedited and
      edited images was 31.53 mm  (0.345%). When we include the direction of the change
      in the analysis, edited images had lower volume values than unedited images
      (mean 7.98 mm , 0.087%), although the difference was not statistically significant
      (  p   = 0.175). \n\nPearson correlations between edited and unedited images
      were calculated by ROI, they all were positive and ranged from 0.744 in the
      right frontal pole to 0.995 in the left supramarginal region. All remained statistically
      significant after Bonferroni correction. The correlations are presented in  .
      \n\n\n\n### The ENIGMA and Freeview Quality Control Protocols \n  \nOverall,
      the Freeview quality control protocol was more permissive than the ENIGMA protocol
      with 7,824 accepted datapoints compared to ENIGMAs 7,208, out of possible 8,228
      (  p   < 0.0001). The largest differences in both directions between Freeview
      and ENIGMA quality control protocols were found in the left middle temporal
      gyrus (Freeview 119; ENIGMA 77; difference 42,   p   < 0.0001) and the left
      precuneus (Freeview 91; ENIGMA 110; difference 19,   p   = 0.0011). The worst
      quality areas (measured by total datapoints across both protocols) were the
      right postcentral gyrus and the right middle temporal gyrus with 187 and 188
      (out of possible 242) valid datapoints, respectively. The number of included
      datapoints per ROI is presented in  . The number of subjects that passed the
      protocols with no ROI exclusions was relatively low: three for the Freeview
      volumetric protocol, 22 for the Freeview CT protocol, and three for the ENIGMA
      protocol (15 passes for the external and 25 passes for the internal view; notably,
      the internal was rated as pass if it did not result in additional exclusions
      when viewed after the external view, and therefore the number of passes is overestimated).
      \n\n\n### ENIGMA Exclusion Differences Between Edited and Unedited Images \n  \nThe
      sample size for this analysis was 61 participants, in total 4,148 ROIs per hemisphere.
      In the left hemisphere, 238 edited and 318 unedited ROIs were excluded (  p   =
      0.0003). In the right hemisphere, 215 edited and 319 unedited ROIs were excluded
      (  p   < 0.0001). In total, 453 edited and 637 unedited ROIs were excluded (  p   <
      0.0001). \n\nAmong the edited images, there were 10 that passed the external
      view without any ROI exclusions (unedited 5,   p   = 0.17), and 13 that passed
      the internal view (unedited 3,   p   = 0.0073). \n\nSome typical examples of
      the differences between edited and unedited images in the ENIGMA internal view
      are presented in  . \n  \n (A)   Shows an error in the right precentral gyrus,
      where the cortex is too thin (yellow circle).   (B)   is the edited image of
      the same participant, and the error is no longer visible in the region (green
      circle). In addition,   (C)   Shows the right precentral gyrus extending into
      the skull.   (D)   Shows the edited image of the same participant, where this
      error is no longer present. Notable, the right precentral gyrus is a region
      where significant differences between edited and unedited images were observed
      in cortical thickness and surface area values. \n  \n\n### Sex Differences \n  \nMore

      the semiautomated segmentation procedure we used for image processing in detail.
      While this work relied heavily on existing guidelines by FreeSurfer and the
      ENIGMA consortium, we believe this article is of help for investigators that
      are new to pediatric neuroimaging. We add to the existing literature by assessing
      the effects of our manual edits on CT values, reporting the agreement between
      FreeSurfer and CAT12, and comparing the FreeSurfers standard recon-all to other
      optional flags. \n\nThe manual edits had relatively minor effects on the CT
      values, less than 2% in all regions [comparable with earlier results by  ],
      however it should be noted that the larger effects (such as 0.05 mm in the right
      caudal middle frontal) are bigger than the yearly change in CT in children [as
      estimated from figures in   and  ]. Importantly, consistent bias in the absolute
      values may not be an issue when examining longitudinal data, as the values can
      be scaled to only account for the relative value compared to group average.
      However, as this change represents measurement error due to artifact in the
      image as opposed to real difference in cortical thickness, reducing this variability
      should bring the results closer to the true values, whether scaled or absolute.
      Edited images had larger CT values in most cases where significant differences
      were seen. This is not surprising, as most of the editing time is spent correcting
      small errors in the WMGM border, and fixing these errors typically thickens
      the cortex (as can be seen in  ). Errors where pia extends too far into dura
      or cerebrospinal fluid also exist, but naturally only occur in areas next those
      tissue types. Therefore, they occur repeatedly in the same regions, canceling
      out some of the bias caused be them. These errors are typically located in the
      superior parts of frontal and parietal lobes, in regions such as the rostral
      and caudal middle frontal, superior frontal, superior parietal, precentral,
      and postcentral gyri. These are the same regions where most of the errors in
      the WMGM border are seen. Furthermore, the errors are quite reliably approximately
      one to two voxels in thickness (e.g.,  ), while WMGM border errors can be greater
      in magnitude and occur anywhere in the brain (e.g.,  ). Furthermore, it is crucial
      to note that the errors in pial surface mainly affect CT estimates SA is often
      measured from WMGM border and is therefore unaffected by the pial errors ( ),
      and volumetric segmentation needs to be assessed separately from surfaces. Thinner
      cortex in edited images was seen in only two regions. In case of the right rostral
      anterior cingulate, there are some arteries adjacent to it, and erasing them
      may have had a thinning effect on cortical thickness ( ). However, the reason
      for the apparent thinning of the superior temporal region is unclear. \n\nSimilarly,
      the effects of edits on SA values were relatively minor, less than 3% in all
      areas and less than 1% on average. A previous study found no significant differences
      in SA between edited and unedited images ( ). Our results are similar in the
      sense that differences were not seen in most regions. However, there were a
      few exceptions, notably including some of the areas with more motion artifact
      and subsequently more edits, such as the pre- and postcentral gyri as well as
      the superior parietal region. Where differences were seen, edited images always
      had smaller SA values. This was to be expected, considering the nature of our
      edits. FreeSurfer measures the surface area from the WMGM border, a structure
      that most of our edits affect.   depicts a typical edit made to the WM mask,
      which corrects an erroneous fold in the WMGM border, thus making SA in that
      region smaller. The effects for volume were minor, and previous research suggests
      that the effects are small enough to not affect results when examining correlations
      between brain volume and neurocognitive tasks ( ). \n\nThe manual editing procedures
      in many of the previous studies focusing on manual edits ( ;  ;  ) all roughly
      resemble the FreeSurfer instructions for manual editing and quality control.   focused
      on volumes in certain ROIs, the amygdala, the hippocampus, the anterior cingulate
      cortex, and the temporal lobe, in a sample aged 1117 years. Average manual editing
      time was 9.5 h, which is a very long time compared to our visual quality control
      and editing protocol of circa 2 h. They did edit pial errors (such as the one
      presented in   and  ), which could explain a large part of this difference in
      the time requirement.   examined the effects of manual edits on CT, SA, and
      WM volumes in a sample of young adults. They also included pial and control
      point edits in addition to WM mask edits. In the 3 Tesla images, there were
      no differences between edited and unedited groups in SA or WM volume. There
      were a few areas with differences in CT, and the areas involved in both our
      and their studies (including those that approached significance in their study)
      were the inferior temporal, superior frontal, precentral, and caudal middle
      frontal regions.   focused on effects of pial error correction on volumes in
      a large sample of adults.   studied the effects of manual editing on six bilateral
      ROIs (the fusiform, pars opercularis, inferior parietal as well as inferior,
      middle, and superior temporal regions) in 56-years-old children (  n   = 56).
      Edited images had higher SA and lower CT, but the difference was consistent,
      and therefore the group comparison results were similar with either data set.
      Although at a glance these results seem to be directly opposed to ours, the
      choice of 12 ROIs (when looking at hemispheres separately) should be considered.
      In our data, edited images had lower CT in 7/12 regions (right superior temporal
      statistically significant, edited lower CT than unedited, both inferior temporal
      gyri were significant in the opposite direction), and higher SA in 2/12 (only
      the right inferior temporal gyrus statistically significant, edited lower SA
      than unedited). Overall, the inferior temporal gyrus was the main difference
      between our results, being significant in the opposite direction than expected
      based on the results by Beelen et al. Notably, the lack of pial edits in our
      protocol and an emphasis on fixing errors where the WMGM border extends too
      far into the cortex could explain why the CT results differ. The reason why
      our edits make SA smaller rather than larger was discussed earlier, while the
      reason for the opposite finding might be related to abundant use of control
      points, however this is speculative. In all these studies, the main conclusion
      (regarding the manual editing) was that it did not significantly affect results/conclusions,
      even if there were significant differences in the CT, SA, or volume values.
      In our study, we cannot assess the effects of these edits on the results of
      some non-neuroimaging test. However, we highlight a benefit rarely discussed
      in earlier literature. The manual edits improved image quality, allowing for
      more ROIs in more participants to pass the visual quality assessment, in effect
      rising the number of usable datapoints within the sample. \n\nWe also examined
      the effects of our manual editing and quality control protocol on the results
      regarding sex differences and structural asymmetry. We observed differences
      in the number of regions with sex differences, wherein there were more significant
      findings without quality control (especially with CT). Notably, the quality
      control protocol leads to exclusion of some ROIs in some participants, and therefore
      some of this effect may be due to decreased sample size. However, this effect
      was also seen in regions with few exclusions, such as the left caudal middle
      frontal, left paracentral, and left posterior cingulate regions, suggesting
      that it is not the only cause for this difference, and our results imply that
      the lack of quality control may lead to some false positive findings. Furthermore,
      we found some regions that only showed sex differences after the quality control
      protocol. These differences were mostly seen in volumes. Notably, these regions
      include the left inferior and middle temporal gyri, regions that were quite
      often excluded due to topological errors. This suggests that the errors in automated
      segmentation in this area may be large enough to cause false negative findings,
      unless addressed either by manually fixing the errors, which can be an arduous
      and time-consuming process, or excluding the erroneous cases from analyses.
      In conclusion, manual editing and quality control can affect the results in
      group comparisons or examinations of structural asymmetry of brain structure.
      \n\nOur conclusion seems to differ from earlier research, that suggests that
      additional manual editing is not necessary ( ;  ;  ;  ). Notably, most of these
      studies were done on adolescents ( ) or adults ( ;  ). Older participants move
      less during the scan, leading to less errors in segmentation. Understandably,
      editing has less utility when images are already of higher quality.   had a
      similar age group to our study. They examined CT and SA in 12 ROIs, and found
      two cases with differences between fully automated and edited versions (SA in
      right inferior temporal gyrus and CT in the pars opercularis). Two out of 24
      ROIs (12 CT, 12 SA) is 8.3%, compared to our 13.2% (18/136, only CT and SA measurements
      of sex differences), suggesting that our findings are not radically different
      from earlier research. Of course, this comparison cannot be made directly, considering
      the differences group comparison and editing protocols. \n\nFor inclusion and
      exclusion criteria of images, we propose that there are two major approaches:
      micro and macro scale approach. In the micro scale assessment, we could find
      the errors as described in the methods section and score the image based on
      their number and size. However, this approach has multiple challenges. Firstly,
      there are many errors that do not warrant exclusion of the ROI in question,
      e.g., small errors in the WMGM border (demonstrated in  ). In some cases, these
      types of errors were abundant despite rarely meeting the exclusion criteria.
      How should the number of these errors be calculated and what weight should they
      be given compared to larger errors? Secondly, in many cases it is not obvious
      whether there is an error in the slice or not (one typical case is an image
      with poor WMGM contrast). If we were to count errors by the number of slices
      with a certain type of error, differences between raters could lead to large
      differences in these cases. These could be viewed by multiple expert raters
      and discussed, however that would be very time consuming and arduous, while
      one of the main goals of semiautomated segmentation programs is to make the
      process as fast and easy as possible. Thirdly, quality control protocols are
      often described on a general level in scientific studies ( ;  ;  ;  ), and therefore
      there is no commonly accepted way to assess all the errors in the automated
      segmentation. \n\nIn contrast, in the macro scale assessment, the rater can
      quickly look at the brain image, and assess the amount of motion artifact (i.e.,
      motion as marked by waves or concentric rings in the typical MPRAGE image) and
      the clarity of the WMGM border. In borderline cases, the image can be segmented
      and then assessed for major segmentation errors, such as ubiquitous errors in
      the WMGM border or large unsegmented areas. One key challenge with this approach
      is the lack of objective criteria, as these types of errors are very difficult
      to quantify or to describe in articles or instructions. However, the expert
      rater makes this same assessment for all images and can learn to quickly exclude
      the images that are of significantly poorer quality than others, and therefore
      a high internal reliability should be attainable. Furthermore, as this type
      of assessment can be made quickly, unclear cases can be verified by other raters
      with little additional time commitment. Considering the pros and cons of both
      approaches, we decided to use macro scale assessment for exclusion of whole
      images. Furthermore, we decided to apply it on a dichotomous pass or fail scale
      and skip further quality classification. One possible downside is the loss of
      subcategories in the accepted sample, since image quality can be included in
      regression analyses ( ). However, in our study, we perform a rigorous quality
      control protocol that rates image quality on a level of single ROIs, and therefore
      all datapoints in the final sample are of high quality. Consequently, we believe
      a further categorization based on overall image quality would not add significant
      value in this case. \n\nWe decided to apply the widely used and accepted ENIGMA
      quality control protocol ( ) to support decisions on inclusion and exclusion
      of ROIs. It has previously been implemented for both adults ( ) and children
      ( ;  ). The internal view of ENIGMA protocol gives 16 slices with color coded
      segmented ROIs. This gives a good overall view of the brain, but it does not
      allow for exploration of unclear cases, and some errors can be completely missed
      if they are not located in the slices presented by ENIGMA. To explore this issue,
      we presented our own Freeview quality control protocol, and as a result of using
      Freeview for slice-by-slice assessment of the brain (e.g., the errors seen in  )
      it was more sensitive to certain types of small errors than the ENIGMA protocol.
      However, this protocol was not implemented for the final analyses due to the
      challenges discussed earlier in this article, such as the large number of minor
      errors and the lack of consensus on how to treat them. For example, the areas
      that were the most commonly excluded from the volumetric analyses in the Freeview
      protocol were the left lingual gyrus and left precuneus ( ). Both regions are
      adjacent to the posterior tip of the lateral ventricle and were therefore often
      excluded due to a few mislabeled voxels. Overall, the Freeview protocol was
      more permissive than the ENIGMA protocol. One major reason for this is that
      it lacks the external view that ENIGMA has and therefore cannot assess errors
      in borders between ROIs. Therefore, even if the Freeview quality control protocol
      were implemented, it would have to be implemented together with the ENIGMA protocol.
      However, future studies should explore the utility of slice-by-slice assessment
      of the Freeview image, as some of the errors found via that method may be large
      enough to warrant exclusion from statistical analyses. \n\nThe key practical
      benefit in our manual edits protocol is the relative ease of application. Errors
      caused by remaining parts of the skull are very clear and easy to fix ( ). Fixing
      arteries by erasing all voxels between certain intensity values requires practically
      no decision-making during execution. Edits in the WMGM border take the most
      time and require the most expertise. However, as the edits are followed by another
      automated recon-all protocol, that considers the human input in calculations,
      the editor cannot decide the exact delineation between WM and GM, and therefore
      cannot make errors that would mandate editing the image again from scratch.
      Such errors were possible while editing the SSS (please see  ,  , pages 1014),
      however SSS edits were stopped after an interim analysis. While it could be
      argued that the effect on CT values is not worth the time that manual edits
      require, we believe that systematic manual edits protocol has an additional
      benefit: It maximizes the chance to find and fix errors that would lead to exclusion
      of the ROI in question, therefore increasing the number of valid datapoints
      in the final sample. \n\nThere is an increased need for manual edits and diligent
      quality control in pediatric imaging. Children move more than adults during
      scans ( ;  ;  ), and therefore there is an increase in ringing and blurring
      artifacts in images. The artifact can lead to unreliable cortical parcellations,
      and the errors must be noted and fixed when possible. While previous studies
      suggest that the effects of edits on brain metrics may be small enough to not
      affect group comparisons ( ;  ), we observed an increased inclusion rate in
      the ENIGMA quality control protocol, which effectively increased our potentially
      available sample size. Furthermore, the choice of automated segmentation tool
      can be very influential. For example, in adults, FreeSurfer and CAT12 have shown
      good agreement ( ;  ), however in our sample the agreement was relatively poor.
      CAT12 often overestimated CT compared to FreeSurfer, but the opposite was also
      true a significant number of cases, showing that the disagreement was not systematic.
      Therefore, the results cannot be reliably compared in this population. Please
      see   ( , pages 1925, CAT12) for more discussion. Furthermore, a childs brain
      undergoes non-linear regional developments through its development, which means
      it cannot simply be considered a slightly smaller adult brain ( ;  ). \n\nCertain
      typical errors can appear in unedited pediatric FreeSurfer images when applying
      adult templates, as presented in a review by  . The review presents the errors
      in pial border that were often seen in the temporal regions in our sample. On
      the other hand, cerebellum was mislabeled only once in our final sample ( ).
      Additionally, we did observe erroneous automatic segmentation in the subcortical
      regions, and we are preparing an article regarding the manual segmentation of
      these areas ( ). Similarly, pediatric atlases have their own challenges. One
      key challenge with age specific atlases is that the required specificity regarding
      the age range is unclear. Multiple age specific atlases, some of them freely
      available, have been created for neonates and infants ( ;  ), and they have
      shown good agreement with the gold standard manual segmentation ( ;  ). The
      age ranges in these atlases may be very specific, e.g., covering the preterm
      neonates aged between 29 and 44 gestational weeks ( ). In comparison, in older
      pediatric populations, the age ranges may be a few years or even more than 10
      years ( ;  ). In addition, pediatric atlases have the challenges that atlases
      have in general, such as the specificity of the group (e.g., a certain disease)
      and ROIs. Considering the multitude of different options in pediatric atlases,
      their use may complicate comparisons between studies. Therefore, we decided
      to use the standard adult atlas with appropriate quality control measures to
      counter the challenges this approach has. We were generally satisfied with the
      cortical segmentation results, but it remains an important venue to develop
      and validate implemented in mainstream software such as FreeSurfer ( ;  ). In
      FreeSurfer, adult template is used for creating the volumetric segmentation
      ( ). The aseg is also partially used when initializing the surfaces; after that,
      the surfaces are placed based on following intensity gradients which are independent
      of any atlas. \n\nOne of the key limitations in our study is the reliance on
      visual assessment in the quality control. Considering the inherent arbitrariness
      of the visual assessment of motion artifact, there is interest in developing
      automated quality assessment algorithms ( ). An automated, objective estimate
      of the severity of the motion might allow us to set universal standards on the
      different categories of motion severity. There are some challenging key questions
      that would need to be resolved before the creation of a system to correct for
      motion artifact: (1) how much different levels of motion affect different aspects
      of brain morphology (Blumenthal et al. provide estimates of the decrease in
      volume in a seemingly non-linear manner, as the change from moderate to severe
      artifact causes a major drop in volumes compared to the other classifications);
      and (2) are the effects similar throughout the brain or are there significant
      regional differences. Considering these challenges, more research is needed
      before the effects of motion artifact can be accounted for automatically. Another
      approach is to lessen motion artifact by adding prospective motion correction
      (PMC) to the T1-weighted imaging sequence ( ). The benefit is clearest in images
      with a lot of motion artifact, while the cost is poorer performance in some
      quality control measures such as signal to noise ratio compared to a MPRAGE
      sequence without PMC ( ). While implementation of PMC could improve the quality
      of our data, it would not remove the need a quality control protocol such as
      the one we presented in this article, and therefore the existence of this alternative
      imaging sequence does not impact our main findings. Although we opted for a
      quality control protocol that performs visual quality control on a level of
      individual ROIs, investigators may additionally benefit from using custom software
      to detect potentially low quality data ( ). \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThere
      is no single gold standard processing method for pediatric images, and thus
      there is methodological variation between different studies. Pediatric images
      are inherently more susceptible for segmentation errors than adult images. This
      highlights the need for rigorous quality control to ensure high quality data.
      We believe that detailed method descriptions are crucial for maximal transparency
      that helps comparisons between studies. \n\nIn this article we have described
      in detail the semiautomated segmentation protocol used in the FinnBrain Neuroimaging
      Lab, including manual edits and the implementation of the ENIGMA quality control
      protocol. We decided to use the standard recon-all without optional registration
      flags, as they did not provide additional benefits. Furthermore, we observed
      a surprisingly poor agreement between FreeSurfer and CAT12 output. Our semiautomated
      segmentation protocol provides means to assure the high quality of pediatric
      neuroimaging data and could help investigators working with similar data sets.
      \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets presented in this article
      are not readily available because research data cannot be shared publicly. The
      ethics committee decision and local legislation do not allow the open sharing
      of neuroimaging data. Requests to access the datasets should be directed to
      EP, ( ), and are subject to Finnish legislation and formal local procedures
      for data sharing. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThe studies involving human
      participants were reviewed and approved by Joint Ethics Committee of the University
      of Turku and the Hospital District of Southwest Finland. Written informed consent
      to participate in this study was provided by the participants legal guardian/next
      of kin. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nEP, ESi, and JT conceptualized the
      work and drafted initial version of the manuscript. EP, ESi, VK, AC, and ESa
      collected the data. EP and ESi manually edited the data. EP performed the final
      quality check on the data and was supervised by JT. HK and LK started the FinnBrain
      Birth Cohort and provided the infrastructure for the studies. All authors critically
      revised the manuscript and accepted it in its final form. \n\n\n## Conflict
      of Interest \n  \nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the
      absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed
      as a potential conflict of interest. \n\n\n## Publishers Note \n  \nAll claims
