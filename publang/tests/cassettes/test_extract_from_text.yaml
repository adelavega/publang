      \n  \nSocial cognitive deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia (Sz) ( )
      and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and contribute to impaired functional outcome
      ( ;  ). One important aspect of social functioning is the ability to rapidly
      and accurately perceive facial expressions. Impaired face-emotion recognition
      (FER) has been extensively reported in Sz ( ;  ) and ASD ( ;  ;  ) however the
      underlying neuronal substrates of these deficits are not fully understood and,
      indeed, may arise from differential underlying neural pathologies ( ). Over
      recent years, the contribution of sensory-processing deficits to cognitive impairments
      has been increasingly appreciated ( ;  ), including the potential role of dysfunction
      within subcortical components of the afferent visual streams ( ;  ). Here, we
      utilize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate the contributions
      of impaired early sensory processing to FER impairments in Sz. Data were collected
      as well from both neurotypical and ASD comparison groups to assess the specificity
      and magnitude of observed activation deficits in Sz. \n\nDuring normative brain
      function, FER is supported by activation of specific components of the social
      brain( ), which includes structures along both the dorsal and ventral visual-cortical
      pathways ( ;  ;  ). These pathways receive retinal information from the lateral
      geniculate nucleus (LGN), which projects to primary visual cortex (V1). The
      dorsal pathway receives its primary input from the magnocellular geniculostriate
      pathway and is specialized for rapid detection of low spatial-frequency and
      motion information. Key dorsal structures include motion-sensitive mid-temporal
      regions (MT, MST). In Sz, differential deficits in magnocellular processing
      have been reported and related to potentially impaired patterns of sensory gain
      and functions of the N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (NMDAR) (reviewed
      in  ). Moreover, impairments in magnocellular function correlate with behavioral
      measures of impaired FER in Sz, supporting the involvement of this pathway in
      social cognition ( ,  ;  ). By contrast, the ventral visual stream receives
      predominant input from the subcortical parvocellular system and is specialized
      for slower but higher-resolution processing of stimulus details. Key targets
      of the ventral stream include visual area V4 and the fusiform face complex (FFC).
      \n\nAlong with the ventral and dorsal pathways, the presence of an anatomically
      and functionally distinct third pathway specialized for social perception and
      comprising the superior temporal sulcus (STS) region, has recently been proposed
      ( ). The STS region has been reliably associated with processing biological
      motion signals ( ;  ;  ) including dynamic social cues such as the changeable
      aspects of facial features (eyes, lips). Impaired STS activation has been documented
      in Sz but the basis for the deficit remains unknown ( ;  ,  ;  ;  ). \n\nIn
      addition to the cortical system, humans retain an evolutionarily old retinotectal
      system that mediates non-conscious affective processing   via   amygdala, superior
      colliculus and the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus (PulN) (reviewed in  ).
      In addition to mediating retinogeniculate input into visual cortex, PulN also
      mediates cortico-cortical interactions between successive brain regions within
      the dorsal and ventral stream pathways (e.g.,  ), and is the site of greatest
      NMDAR density within primate thalamus ( ). \n\nPulN is anatomically divided
      into discrete, functionally differentiated subdivisions (e.g.,  ;  ). For example,
      the visual pulvinar, consisting of its inferior (PI) and lateral (PL) subdivisions,
      has dense connections with early visual sensory regions ( ) and likely plays
      a modulatory role in visual information processing ( ). In addition, projections
      from PI specifically innervate motion sensitive regions surrounding area MT,
      especially MST ( ), and also serve as drivers to secondary areas of visual cortex
      (e.g., V2) and as modulators to V1 ( ). On the other hand, medial pulvinar (PM)
      is considered multimodal and is primarily coupled with prefrontal and temporal
      regions including STS ( ) and may play a unique role in processing emotional
      information (reviewed in  ). \n\nHere, we evaluate whole-brain fMRI activation
      patterns during FER in Sz, relative to both neurotypical individuals and ASD.
      Inclusion of ASD participants is based on a previous study involving simple
      visual stimuli in which we observed a divergent pattern of disturbance within
      early visual areas and PulN relative to Sz patients, despite similar magnitude
      of FER impairment ( ). We hypothesized that, in Sz, deficits within FER-related
      higher tier visual regions (e.g., STS) would be driven significantly by impaired
      activation of both early visual regions (e.g., V1, MST) and PulN as well as
      by impaired cortico-pulvinar interactions. Moreover, we hypothesized that deficit
      patterns would be differential across Sz and ASD participants despite similar
      levels of behavioral impairment, suggesting disorder-specific pathophysiological
      mechanisms underlying social cognitive impairments in neuropsychiatric populations.
      \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nSeventy-eight participants
      took part, including 28 participants (age range 2154 years) diagnosed with schizophrenia
      (Sz) using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV ( ), 20 adults with
      autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (age range 1943 years), confirmed by the Autism
      Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition, and 30 neurotypical controls
      (age range 1954 years) ( ). All Sz participants were on a stable dose of antipsychotic
      medication. All participants had at least 20/22 corrected visual acuity on a
      Logarithmic Visual Acuity Chart. On average, Sz participants were older [  F  (1,
      56) = 7.24,   p   = 0.009] and had lower IQ scores [  F  (1, 56) = 6.54,   p   =
      0.013] than controls. All ASD participants and a subset of 19 Sz and 17 controls
      participated in our previous EEG/fMRI study of visual sensory dysfunction as
      reported in  , which did not include data from the present paradigm. Participants
      were recruited from the central research database and volunteer recruitment
      pool at the Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research (NKI). The investigation
      was approved by the Nathan Kline Institute (NKI) institutional review board.
      Informed consent was obtained from all participants. \n  \nParticipant characteristics.
      \n    \n\n### Paradigm \n  \nUnique video clips of five actors (three male)
      dynamically expressing each of four emotions (happy, sad, angry, fearful) were
      selected from the University of Cambridge Mind Reading Emotions Library (adult
      level 6) ( ). Five additional actors (two male) from the NKI community acted
      a neutral expression consisting of non-emotionally salient head/eye movements
      (left/right, up/down). Neutral videos were matched in size, resolution and luminance
      to emotion videos. For each video, representative single frames were extracted
      and used as corresponding static stimuli. Both dynamic and static stimuli were
      presented for 2 s each followed by a 400 ms interstimulus interval (ISI). In
      each of two 7.5-min fMRI scans, dynamic and static stimuli of a single emotion
      or neutral were delivered in 12-s blocks (5 stimuli per block), interleaved
      with 10-s of fixation-only. A total of ten blocks of static and 10 blocks of
      dynamic faces were presented in random order per scan ( ). Across both scans
      a total of 200 stimuli were delivered, 20 of each of four emotions plus neutral,
      either dynamic or static. To ascertain that participants were attending the
      stimuli, participants responded by button press to a single predesignated actor
      chosen randomly for each participant, irrespective of emotion or motion. The
      target actor appeared in 10% of all stimuli. \n  \n (A)   Schematic of fMRI
      paradigm. A total of 20 blocks lasting 12 s each were delivered in random order
      in each of two fMRI scans. Each block consisted of faces expressing a single
      emotion (happy, sad, angry, fear) or neutral expression either dynamically or
      statically.   (B)   FER accuracy determined in the behavioral paradigm administered
      outside the scanner, for dynamic (filled bars) and static (open) faces in control
      (CTL; blue), schizophrenia (SZ; orange), and autism (ASD; green). Relative to
      the CTL group, FER accuracy was significantly lower in the SZ and ASD groups
      for both dynamic (left bars) and static (right) faces. In SZ patients, FER accuracy
      for dynamic faces was especially reduced, relative to control participants.   (C)   Mean
      FER accuracy as a function of face-emotion and (below) sample stimuli used for
      happy, sad, angry and fear emotions. FER accuracy did not differ overall as
      a function of face-emotion and group membership.   (D)   Groupwise scores on
      the Penn Emotion Recognition (ER-40) test. As expected, both SZ and ASD participants
      had significantly lower ER-40 scores compared to the CTL group, which,   (E)   were
      correlated with accuracy on the FER task. In all cases, significance of group
      differences is denoted by asterisks, relative to CTL (*  p   < 0.05; **  p   <
      0.01;***  p   < 0.005). \n  \n\n### Behavior Measures \n  \nA forced-choice
      behavioral task was administered following the fMRI scan using the same static
      and dynamic emotional face stimuli (80 stimuli total, 20 of each type; neutral
      faces were not included). As in the fMRI scan, each static/dynamic stimulus
      was presented for 2 s. After each presentation, subjects were prompted to press
      one of five buttons to indicate if the actors expression was (1) happy, (2)
      sad, (3) angry, (4) fearful, or (5) none of the above. Accuracy, as opposed
      to response time was emphasized. The trial ended when subjects responded. To
      compare findings from our FER paradigm with those from a validated and reliable
      measure of FER, the Penn Emotion Recognition test (ER-40) ( ) was also administered
      to all participants and its results compared to those of the present FER paradigm.
      The ER-40 uses forty color photographs of faces expressing four basic emotionshappiness,
      sadness, anger, or fearplus neutralwith eight photographs for each category,
      presented in random order. Participants were instructed to choose the correct
      emotion from among the five listed choices (forced choice) by clicking a computer
      mouse as quickly as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Each image was displayed
      until a choice was made. \n\n\n### Functional Imaging \n  \nImaging took place
      on a Siemens 3T TiM Trio scanner. Two-hundred-twenty T2*-weighted echo-planar
      images (EPIs) (  TR   = 2,000 ms;   TE   = 30 ms;   FA   = 90; FOV = 240 mm;
      slice thickness = 2.8 mm) were acquired on each of 36 contiguous slices in the
      axial plane. At least one high-resolution structural image of the entire brain
      was acquired from each participant using an MPRAGE sequence (  TR   = 2500 ms;   TE   =
      3.5 ms; FOV = 256 mm, slice thickness = 1.0 mm, 192 slices). \n\nIndividual
      cortical surfaces were rendered from the high-resolution anatomical images using
      Freesurfer and registered to the std 0.141 fsaverage mesh ( ) with SUMA.  The
      pulvinar and amygdala were derived individually using a Bayesian atlas-based
      automated segmentation methods ( ;  ;  ) incorporated in Freesurfer. Functional
      data were preprocessed and analyzed using the Analysis of Functional NeuroImages
      (AFNI) software ( ;  ). Preprocessing consisted of concatenating data from two
      runs, removal of signal deviation >2.5 SDs from the mean (AFNIs 3dDespike),
      temporal alignment, identification of motion outliers per run and scaling of
      blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) values to mean percent signal change ( ).
      For surface-based analyses, the data was spatially smoothed with a 6 mm full
      width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. Single-participant statistical analyses
      were conducted within the framework of the general linear model (GLM). The GLM
      model included regressors for each stimulus type (emotional dynamic, emotional
      static, neutral dynamic, neutral static) as well as regressors for the six motion
      parameters (three rotations, three translations) and their first derivatives,
      per run. Time points with large head motion between successive time points were
      censored. Surface-based analyses were carried out on the gray-matter ordinates
      of each individual cortical surface aligned to the Freesurfer 141-standard mesh.
      Cortical data was sampled to the Human Connectome Project multimodal cortical
      parcellation (HCP-MMP1.0) ( ), resampled to fsaverage, which delineates 180
      brain parcels per hemisphere based on functional and structural properties.
      To assess activation of pulvinar and amygdala, analyses were conducted in the
      individual native-space volumes. Primary analyses involved the entire pulvinar.
      In secondary analyses, beta parameters were extracted from pulvinar subdivisions
      and tested separately. \n\nTo avoid issues related to circularity in data analysis
      ( ), activated parcels were first identified by an unpaired   t  -test of mean
      activation (vs. 0), collapsed over all stimuli, across all seventy-eight participants
      thresholded at an (uncorrected)   p  -value of 0.001 ( ). This analysis defined
      a mask consisting of 35 bilateral parcels (70 parcels total) ( ) in the HCP
      MMP1.0 parcellation atlas which was used in subsequent analyses of functional
      data.   lists each parcel. \n  \n (A)   Whole-brain beta parameter maps of activation
      elicited by all stimuli and across all participants, superimposed on the template
      brain with borders of HCP parcels demarcated.   (B)   Thirty-five parcels with
      significant activation collapsed across subjects and face stimuli. \n    \nMean
      beta parameter values in each of the 35 HCP-MMP1.0 ( ) parcels shown in   for
      the control (CTL), schizophrenia (SZ), and autism (ASD) groups. \n    \n\n###
      General Statistics \n  \nMean beta parameter estimates were extracted from individual
      parcels and entered into an omnibus repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)
      collapsing over all parcels identified as having significant across-group activation
      (  n   = 35 parcels per hemisphere,  ). Diagnostic group (control, Sz, ASD)
      was included as a between-subject factor. Face-motion type (dynamic, static)
      and face-emotion type (emotional, neutral) were included as within-subject factors.
      To minimize concerns regarding multiple comparisons, follow-up tests on individual
      parcels were conducted only if the initial group X parcel interaction was significant.
      Pre-planned subcortical regions (PulN, amygdala) were evaluated in separate
      ANOVAs with factors group, face-motion and face-emotion. \n\nEffect sizes of
      between-group differences were calculated using Cohens   d   (mean/std dev).
      \n\nThe interrelationship between behavioral measures of FER and cortical/subcortical
      activation patterns was assessed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with group
      membership as the categorical factor. Follow up ANCOVAs were conducted in a
      sequential fashion, for each significant covariate effect obtained in the prior
      analysis. In each case, only a single ANCOVA was performed for the region being
      tested as the dependent variable with all remaining covariates. The covariate
      x group interaction was used to evaluate group differences in the relationship
      between covariates. \n\nAll statistics were two-tailed with preset  level for
      significance of   p   < 0.05. \n\n\n### Mediation Analyses \n  \nBased on our
      prior findings ( ), we used exploratory linear mediation analyses to explore
      the role of PulN subdivisions and cortical activation patterns in Sz patients.
      Analyses were conducted within SPSS26  using the PROCESS macro ( ). A three-variable
      path model (model 4) was used to examine the predictor-outcome relationship
      between interrelated regions with impaired activation in Sz (relative to controls)
      and the potential mediating role of each PulN subdivision (PL, PI, PM). As per
      standard conventions, the link between the predictor and mediator variable is
      referred to as path   a  , and that between the mediator and the outcome (controlling
      for the predictor), is path   b  . The overall predictor-outcome relationship
      is effect   c  , and the direct effect, after controlling for the mediator is,   c  .
      The indirect (mediation) effect is the product of a*b and tests the significance
      of   c  c  . Statistical significance of indirect pathways, reflecting the impact
      of mediation, was evaluated using a nonparametric bootstrap approach with 10,000
      replication samples to obtain a 95% confidence interval (CI) ( ). The mediation
      effects were considered statistically significant if the bootstrapped 95% CI
      did not include zero. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavior \n  \nOverall, FER
      accuracy was significantly lower in both Sz [  F  (1, 56) = 15.02,   p   < 0.001]
      and ASD participants [  F  (1, 48) = 7.67,   p   = 0.009] compared to controls
      but did not differ between Sz and ASD [  F  (1, 46) = 0.03,   p   = 0.863] participants
      ( ). \n\nAcross groups, FER accuracy was equivalent for dynamic and static faces
      [  F  (1, 75) = 0.314,   p   = 0.576], however, the group x face-motion interaction
      was significant [  F  (2, 75) = 8.26,   p   < 0.001], reflecting relatively
      greater deficits for processing dynamic faces in Sz patients compared to controls
      [  F  (1, 56) = 11.70,   p   = 0.001;   d   = 1.4 dynamic faces;   d   = 0.82
      static faces]. Consequently, mean FER accuracy for dynamic vs. static faces
      was significantly lower in the Sz group [  t  (54) = 2.65,   p   = 0.010] but
      did not differ within either the ASD [  t  (38) = 1.01,   p   = 0.317] nor control
      [  t  (58) = 0.55,   p   = 0.584]. \n\nFER accuracy did not differ overall as
      a function of specific face-emotion type [  F  (6, 146) = 0.84,   p   = 0.541]
      ( ). \n\nAs expected, ER-40 scores were also lower in both Sz [  F  (1, 56)
      = 36.58,   p   < 0.001] and ASD [  F  (1, 48) = 24.57,   p   < 0.001] subjects
      compared to control participants ( ). Further, across subjects, ER-40 scores
      significantly predicted mean accuracy on the FER task [  F  (1, 74) = 8.22,   p   =
      0.005;   R   = 0.407] ( ). \n\nLastly, behavioral performance on the identity
      recognition task during fMRI was marginally worse in Sz [  F  (1, 56) = 3.76,   p   =
      0.058] and significantly worse in ASD [  F  (1, 48) = 4.52,   p   = 0.039] compared
      to controls. \n\n\n### Between-Group Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Activation
      Differences \n  \n#### Cortical Surface \n  \nAn initial omnibus analysis was
      carried out across all parcels in the mask (listed in  ) in order to test the
      null hypothesis that there were no significant activation differences across
      groups. The null hypothesis was falsified by the finding of a significant group
      x parcel interaction [  F  (68, 80) = 1.78,   p   = 0.007]. By contrast, the
      main effect of group membership was non-significant [  F  (2, 73) = 0.106,   p   =
      0.899]. These findings were interpreted as indicating that activation of some,
      but not all, parcels differed significantly in activation across groups ( ).
      \n\nFollow-up analyses were therefore conducted to determine which parcels most
      contributed to the significant interaction effect observed in the omnibus test.
      The goal of these analyses was to identify regions that were most likely to
      contribute to between-group differences in behavioral task-performance. Therefore,
      these analyses were not considered to increase family-wise error rates. \n\nIn
      these protected follow-up analyses, significant main effects of group membership
      were obtained in seven parcels (V1,V2, MST, FFC, TPOJ1, STSdp, FEF) encompassing
      early visual areas [V1:   F  (2, 75) = 4.38,   p   = 0.016; V2:   F  (2, 75)
      = 4.49,   p   = 0.014]; motion-sensitive, medial superior temporal cortex [MST:   F  (2,
      75) = 3.95,   p   = 0.023], fusiform face complex [FFC:   F  (2, 75) = 3.62,   p   =
      0.032]; frontal eye fields [FEF:   F  (2, 75) = 3.63,   p   = 0.031] and the
      posterior superior-temporal cortex including the temporo-parietal junction [TPOJ1:   F  (2,
      75) = 6.88,   p   = 0.002] and the dorsal posterior bank of the superior temporal
      sulcus [STSdp:   F  (2, 75) = 3.16,   p   = 0.048] ( , highlighted parcels;  ).
      \n  \n (A)   Localization of key parcels with overall group differences: early
      visual areas V1 and V2; medial superior temporal cortex (MST); fusiform face
      complex (FFC); frontal eye fields (FEF); temporo-parietal junction (TPOJ1);
      and dorsal posterior superior temporal sulcus (STSdp).   (B)   Mean activation
      (beta parameter) extracted from each key parcel for the control (CTL; blue bars),
      schizophrenia (SZ; orange bars), and autism (ASD; green bars) groups. In parcels
      with a face-motion effect, activation to dynamic (solid bars) and static (open
      bars) faces are plotted separately. Asterisks indicate a significant difference
      in SZ or ASD groups relative to CTL.   (C)   Activation in the STS parcels (TPOJ1,
      STSdp) showing differential activation patterns for dynamic/static, emotional
      (Emo.)/neutral (Neut.) faces in STSdp. \n  \nWhen compared independently to
      the control group, patients with Sz had reduced mean activation in early visual
      [V1:   F  (1, 56) = 10.41,   p   = 0.002,   d   = 0.85] and motion-sensitive
      [MST:   F  (1, 56) = 4.10,   p   = 0.022,   d   = 0.76] parcels. ASD participants,
      in contrast, showed significantly higher activation of early visual regions
      [V2:   F  (1, 48) = 12.52,   p   = 0.001,   d   = 1.03] as well as reduced activity
      in prefrontal cortex [FEF:   F  (1, 48) = 4.24,   p   = 0.045,   d   = 0.59]
      relative to control subjects ( ). \n\nIn parallel with these divergent activation
      patterns, convergent deficits were observed in the pSTS parcels with reduced
      mean activation in both Sz [STSdp:   F  (1, 56) = 5.81,   p   = 0.019,   d   =
      0.97; TPOJ1:   F  (1, 56) = 11.83,   p   = 0.001,   d   = 0.93] and ASD [STSdp:   F  (1,
      48) = 4.48,   p   = 0.040,   d   = 0.86; TPOJ1:   F  (1, 48) = 9.43,   p   =
      0.004,   d   = 0.71] participants, compared to control subjects. Across subjects,
      activation of TPOJ1 was driven strongly by dynamic, relative to static, faces
      [  F  (1, 75) = 57.45,   p   < 0.001] ( ) with no main effect of emotion. In
      contrast, activation of STSdp was larger for both emotional (vs. neutral) [  F  (1,
      75) = 9.19,   p   = 0.003] and dynamic (vs. static) [  F  (1, 75) = 8.73,   p   =
      0.004] faces. Further, deficits in both clinical groups were differentially
      greatest in response to dynamic emotional faces [  F  (2, 75) = 5.28,   p   =
      0.025]. \n\n\n#### Amygdala \n  \nCompared to control subjects, overall activation
      of the amygdala (collapsed across face-motion and face-emotion) was significantly
      higher in Sz patients [  F  (1, 56) = 7.58,   p   = 0.008,   d   = 0.83]. Further,
      the interaction between group-membership and face-emotion was significant [  F  (1,
      56) = 4.93,   p   = 0.030] reflecting greater group differences for emotional,
      relative to neutral, faces [  F  (1, 56) = 4.93,   p   = 0.030] ( ). \n  \n

      For each group, bar plots (top) are of beta values for emotional and neutral

      subdivision. *  p   < 0.05; **  p   < 0.01; ***  p   < 0.001. \n  \nCompared
      to controls, activation of the amygdala was equivalent, overall, in ASD participants
      [  F  (1, 48) = 1.39,   p   = 0.244]. \n\n\n#### Pulvinar \n  \nRelative to
      controls, subcortical activation within PulN was reduced overall in Sz [  F  (1,
      56) = 4.35,   p   = 0.042,   d   = 0.44]. This reduction was relatively greater
      in response to emotional faces as indexed by the significant interaction between
      face-emotion and group membership [  F  (1, 56) = 4.96,   p   = 0.030,   d   =
      0.74] ( , top). \n\nIn contrast, mean activation of the PulN did not differ,
      overall, between ASD and control participants [  F  (1, 48) = 0.260,   p   =
      0.614]. \n\nThe PulN was segmented into its lateral (PL), inferior (PI) and
      medial (PM) subdivisions. Across subdivisions, mean activation differed overall
      as a function of group membership [  F  (2, 75) = 4.91,   p   = 0.009]. In PL
      [  F  (1, 56) = 9.97,   p   = 0.003,   d   = 0.82] and PM [  F  (1, 56) = 10.35,   p   =
      0.002,   d   = 0.84], activation was significantly reduced in Sz relative to
      controls. Neither PL [  F  (1, 48) = 0.068,   p   = 0.795] nor PM [  F  (1,
      48) = 0.127,   p   = 0.723] activation distinguished between ASD and control
      groups ( , bottom). A different pattern was observed in PI where activation
      was equivalent in Sz [  F  (1, 56) = 0.43,   p   = 0.513] compared to controls,
      but significantly enhanced in ASD [  F  (1, 48) = 6.42,   p   = 0.015,   d   =
      0.71], reflecting a disorder-specific, double-dissociation of subnucleus activation
      patterns in Sz vs. ASD. \n\n\n\n### Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Interrelationships
      \n  \nThe interrelationship between FER performance and cortical/subcortical
      activation patterns was assessed by ANCOVA. The results are summarized schematically
      in   (see also  ). \n  \n (A)   Interrelationship between activated cortical
      regions, pulvinar (PulN) activation and face-emotion recognition (FER) accuracy.
      Black lines denote a significant relationship across all groups. Orange lines
      denote significant relationship only in SZ group. Dashed green line denotes
      a significant (negative) correlation in ASD group only.   (B)   Correlation
      between FER accuracy and mean activation (beta) of the STSdp parcel. In all
      cases, black regression lines signify the correlation was significant across
      groups.   (C)   Correlation between STSdp-V1 and STSdp-TPOJ1 activation.   (D)   Correlation
      between STSdp-V2 activation. In ASD participants, enhanced V2 was associated
      with reduced STSdp activation. The opposite relationship was obtained in SZ
      and CTL groups.   (E)   Scatterplots showing a significant and positive correlation
      between PulN activation and TPOJ1 (left), STSdp (center) and MST (right) in
      the SZ group alone. \n  \nAn initial omnibus analysis tested FER simultaneously
      against mean activation in all nine fMRI regions identified in the between-group
      fMRI analyses (seven cortical parcels, amygdala, PulN) ( ). This model tested
      the null hypothesis that no regions significantly predicted FER performance
      beyond the effect of group membership. The model incorporating these covariates
      (Adj.   R   = 0.49) was statistically superior to a model incorporating group
      membership alone [Adj.   R   = 0.35;   F  (9, 68) = 3.42,   p   = 0.0002] (
      ) indicating that incorporation of these covariates significantly improved model
      fit. \n\nThe statistical contribution of the independent covariates was therefore
      considered in order to evaluate which regions contributed most to the overall
      model improvement. As expected, activation of the STSdp parcel most significantly
      predicted FER scores across participants [  F  (1, 66) = 16.61,   p   < 0.001].
      Moreover, a model incorporating only STSdp as a covariate showed a model fit
      (Adj.   R   = 0.51;  ) similar to that of the more complex model incorporating
      all covariates. In this simpler model, the relationship between STSdp and FER
      was highly significant [  F  (1, 74) = 26.24,   p   < 0.001]. In all groups,
      greater activation of STSdp correlated with improved behavioral performance
      (covaried by age and IQ) (Sz:   r   = 0.46,   p   = 0.018; ASD:   r   = 0.53,   p   =
      0.020; control:   r   = 0.41,   p   = 0.029) ( ). By contrast, no significant
      correlation was observed between FER and the other covariates in the analysis.
      \n\nThe relationship between the nine fMRI covariates was assessed in follow-up
      ANCOVAs run in stepwise fashion and including interactions with group membership
      in the model. As these were not independent tests of the overall null hypothesis,
      they were not considered to increase family-wise error regarding potential predictors
      of FER impairments across groups. Rather, the goal was to determine stepwise
      contributions to impaired STSdp activation, which was shown in the omnibus test
      to significantly predict FER across groups. \n\nMean activation of STSdp was
      predicted across groups by both V1 [  F  (1, 51) = 6.19,   p   = 0.016] and
      TPOJ1 [  F  (1, 51) = 6.77,   p   = 0.012] ( ). In turn, V1 was predicted by
      PulN activity [  F  (1, 54) = 8.80,   p   = 0.004], and TPOJ1 was predicted
      by MST [  F  (1, 57) = 18.29,   p   < 0.001], which also predicted FEF activation
      [  F  (1, 61) = 6.63,   p   = 0.012]. There were no further significant interrelationships
      across groups. \n\nAn interaction involving group membership, indicative of
      different slopes, was obtained between STSdp and V2 [  F  (2, 51) = 5.95,   p   =
      0.005] such that in ASD participants enhanced activation of V2 was associated
      with diminished STSdp activity (  r   = 0.71,   p   = 0.001) whereas in controls
      (  r   = 0.42,   p   = 0.023) and Sz (  r   = 0.44,   p   = 0.020) there was
      an inverse relationship ( ). \n\nLastly, group-specific interactions involving
      subcortical (PulN) activity were also obtained. Specifically, in Sz patients
      only, activation of STSdp [  F  (2, 51) = 4.51,   p   = 0.016], TPOJ1 [  F  (2,
      54) = 4.48,   p   = 0.016], and MST [  F  (2, 63) = 3.01,   p   = 0.047] were
      all significantly and positively associated with PulN activation ( ). \n\n\n###
      Mediation Analyses \n  \nA more detailed analysis of subcortical activation
      patterns in Sz was carried out with exploratory mediation analyses involving
      specific PulN subdivisions and interrelated cortical regions. Based on known
      anatomical interrelationships within the early visual system ( ) as well as
      the regression analyses described above, three specific predictor-outcome paths
      were evaluated (V1-STSdp, MST-TPJO1 and TPOJ1-STSdp) with PL, PM, or PI as potential
      mediators. The results are detailed in  . \n  \nResults of mediation analyses
      testing whether a proposed causal effect of X (predictor) on Y (outcome) may
      be transmitted through a mediating (M) variable. \n    \nConsistent with known
      anatomical projections of the lateral subdivision, activation of V1 significantly
      predicted mean PL activity (  p   = 0.001), which in turn predicted STSdp activation
      (  p   = 0.005) ( ). After controlling for PL activity, V1 was no longer associated
      with STSdp (  p   = 0.694), however, using a bootstrapping approach, the (unstandardized)
      coefficient for the indirect pathway from V1 to STSdp (V1  PL  STSdp) was significant
      (CI: [0.08, 0.84]), consistent with full mediation. \n  \n (A)   (Top) Correlations
      between PL and V1 activation (left Y-axis, solid circles) and between PL and
      STSdp activation (right Y-axis, open circles) in SZ patients. (Bottom) Schematic
      of the proposed V1  PL  STSdp path. Beta coefficients are given for the direct
      (a: V1-PL; b: PL-STSdp) and indirect (a*b) paths.   (B)   Correlations and TPOJ1  PM  STSdp
      mediated path.   (C)   Correlations and PI  MST  TPOJ1 path. \n  \nIn addition,
      a significant mediating effect of PM was observed between TPOJ1 and STSdp (TPOJ1  PM  STSdp;
      CI: [0.002, 1.13]) ( ) and of MST between PI and TPOJ1 (PI  MST  TPOJ1; CI:
      [0.13, 0.60]) ( ). In both cases, after controlling for the proposed mediator
      the direct paths between were not significant, suggesting full mediation. \n\n\n\n##
      Clinical Correlations \n  \nNo significant correlations were observed between
      behavioral FER performance or cortical/subcortical activation patterns and medication
      dose (CPZ equivalents) in Sz patients (  p   > 0.15 for all). Functional activation
      strengths did not correlate with measures of general cognitive ability (PSI
      and IQ) in any group (  p   > 0.11 for all), however, in Sz (  r   = 0.378,   p   =
      0.049) and control (  r   = 0.466,   p   = 0.044) participants, perceptual organization
      skill (POI) correlated with performance on the FER task as well as with STSdp
      activation (control:   r   = 0.539,   p   = 0.017; Sz:   r   = 0.399,   p   =
      0.035). \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nDeficits in social cognition contribute disproportionately
      to impaired functional outcome across a range of neurocognitive disorders, including
      Sz and ASD. FER is an important component of these deficits and, in the visual
      system, depends upon coordinated function of both subcortical and cortical regions
      for processing of static and dynamic facial features. Here, we investigated
      cortical and subcortical correlates of FER impairments in adults with Sz and
      ASD using a dynamic/static FER task that engages motion-sensitive areas as well
      as traditional face-processing regions. In addition, we investigated the subcortical
      pathway to cortex involving PulN. \n\nThe primary findings of the study relate
      to the relative involvement of cortico-cortical vs. thalamo-cortical transmission
      paths underlying impaired FER in Sz. Traditionally, it was assumed that cortical
      regions showing intercorrelated activity mediate their joint activations primarily
      through direct cortico-cortical connections ( ;  ). More recent models by contrast
      propose that connections are mediated primarily by successive loops between
      cortex and thalamus, with higher-tier thalamic regions such as PulN and dorsomedial
      nuclei generally interacting with posterior and anterior association regions,
      respectively ( ;  ). Within PulN, discrete subnuclei interact with specific
      visual cortical regions ( ). This theory converges with anatomical studies showing
      reduced PulN volume and cell number in schizophrenia ( ,  ;  ), along with our
      recent observations of impaired PulN activation to simple visual stimuli in
      Sz ( ,  ). \n\nIn the present study, activation deficits in Sz were observed
      within the HCP-MMP1.0 ( ) parcels comprising lower-tier visual regions including
      early visual and motion-sensitive cortex, along with higher-tier (multisensory)
      regions associated with FER. \n\nWithin STS two discrete parcels were activated
      by the task STSdp and TPOJ1. Activation of the STSdp, in particular, showed
      uniquely greater activation to dynamic emotional faces which correlated with
      behavioral measures of FER, in accord with the prominent role of STS in face-emotion
      assessment ( ). In Sz, STSdp deficits intercorrelated with impairments in activation
      of both early visual cortical regions and PulN. \n\n### Role of Pulvinar Subdivisions
      \n  \nPulN is divided into discrete anatomical subdivisions which mirror the
      dorsal/ventral stream distinction of visual cortex ( ) such that the more lateral
      regions (PL) project predominantly to primary visual cortex and ventral visual
      stream, whereas a subset of nuclei in the inferior subdivision (PI) project
      mainly to dorsal stream regions including motion-sensitive cortex (e.g., MST)
      ( ;  ;  ). The medial subdivision (PM) is primarily connected with multimodal
      sensory association areas as well as prefrontal and cingulate cortices and has
      been tied to emotion processing ( ). \n\nIn the present study, in addition to
      intercorrelated cortical activation deficits, we observed correlations between
      cortical regions and PulN subnuclei. We therefore conducted a series of mediation
      analyses to evaluate underlying pathways. \n\nAn initial analysis evaluated
      the potential pathways underlying intercorrelated deficits between V1 and STS
      in the schizophrenia group. A significant indirect pathway from V1PLSTSdp was
      observed, in support of indirect mediation by PL. Consistent with mediation
      by PM, the intercorrelation between the STS parcels (TPOJ1 and STSdp) was not
      significant once an indirect path   via   PM was modeled. \n\nIn contrast, PI
      appeared to mediate its effects   via   MST. Of note, unlike PL and PM, activation
      of PI was relatively intact in patients. Given that PI receives much of its
      driving inputs from neurons in the superior colliculus ( ), this finding is
      suggestive of unimpaired input   via   the retinotectal system. By contrast,
      the observed deficits in V1 are consistent with impaired input   via   the geniculostriate
      visual pathway ( ,  ). \n\nAlthough anatomical abnormalities in PulN are well-documented
      in schizophrenia ( ;  ), the functional consequences of these abnormalities
      have, to date, remained relatively unexplored. Here, we provide evidence that
      impairments in visual PulN function significantly undermines visual processing
      required for effective face processing. In specific, deficits in PL function
      may mediate effects of impaired V1 activation, which, in turn likely reflects
      impaired magnocellular input to cortex. In addition, impaired PM activation
      mediated impaired input from more posterior (TPOJ1) to mid-STS (STSdp) regions,
      suggesting that accumulating deficits across successive cortico-pulvinar loops
      may lead to the large effect-sized deficits in FER-related reduced STS activation
      in Sz. \n\n\n### Comparison to Autism Spectrum Disorders \n  \nWhile deficits
      in social cognition are a prominent component of Sz, they are not unique to
      the disorder. In particular, we ( ) and others ( ;  ) have reported FER deficits
      in adult ASD subjects that are as severe as those observed in Sz, despite the
      much higher level of overall function. Consistent with these prior results,
      adult ASD participants in the present study showed FER and STS activation deficits
      that were similar to those of Sz, supporting a role for STS as a common mediator
      of FER dysfunction across disorders. \n\nDespite the similar STS impairments,
      ASD participants showed markedly different patterns of disturbance within early
      visual regions. In contrast to Sz patients, markedly increased responses and
      an opposite slope of the relationship between V2 and STSdp activation were observed
      in the ASD group. Activation within other task-activated visual regions, including
      V1 and MST, was unaffected in ASD, echoing our recent study in which response
      amplitudes were also normal within V1, but increased in early visual and dorsal
      visual regions ( ). Similar visual hypo/hyper activation patterns in Sz vs.
      ASD have been observed in both fMRI (reviewed in  ;  ) and electrophysiological
      ( ,  ;  ;  ) studies, supporting the concept that dysregulation of the early
      visual system may undermine later stages of visual processing. \n\nPatterns
      of amygdalar and subcortical activation also distinguished between ASD and Sz
      participants. In the amygdala, activation was elevated overall in Sz (but not
      ASD), as reported previously (reviewed in  ), possibly reflecting abnormal salience
      attribution to neutral stimuli ( ;  ;  ), heightened anxiety ( ) and/or paranoid
      ideation ( ). \n\nIn contrast, whereas PulN activity was markedly reduced in
      Sz, activation of the inferior PulN subdivision was significantly elevated in
      ASD participants, in line with findings from our previous studies ( ,  ) and
      those of others ( ;  ;  ). Although the source of the increased activation in
      ASD is not known, a parsimonious explanation would be hyperactivity of the subcortical
      retino-collicular pathway, which provides preferential input to PI ( ) and which,
      in turn, acts like a driver to V2 ( ). In humans, this system typically weakens
      with age as the retinogeniculate system increases in functionality (reviewed
      in  ). Abnormal persistence of this system into adulthood could thus underlie
      the activation disturbance pattern observed in ASD. \n\nRegardless of underlying
      pathophysiology, these findings support the concept that dysregulation of the
      early visual system, whether in the direction of increased or decreased activation,
      may undermine later stages of visual processing and further highlight the importance
      of sensory processing abnormalities to the pathophysiology of social cognitive
      impairment across neuropsychiatric disorders. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nDespite
      our differential findings, some limitations must be considered. First, Sz participants
      were receiving antipsychotic medication which may have impacted measures on
      brain activity. We did not observe any correlations with medication dose, however,
      this issue could be best addressed in future studies involving medication-nave
      patients. Moreover, we note that the overall sample size remains small, and
      the findings need to be replicated in an independent sample. Additionally, we
      did not track fixation locations either in the scanner or during behavior. Thus,
      we do not know if activation failures relate to inability to process information,
      or simply from differential facial scanning approaches. Lastly, Sz participants
      had lower IQ and were older than controls or ASD participants, although correcting
      for IQ and age did not diminish the findings. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn
      summary, higher cortical (e.g., STS) contributions to impaired FER have been
      extensively documented in Sz and ASD ( ), but early visual and subcortical contributions
      have been evaluated to only a limited degree. Here, we demonstrate significant
      but opposite abnormalities of circuits centered on PulN in Sz vs. ASD that correlate
      with impaired STS activation, which in turn correlated across groups with impaired
      FER. These findings highlight the importance of close integration between subcortical
      and cortical visual processing pathways and the potential breakdown of this
      tight coordination in Sz and ASD. Further, the findings reaffirm that similar
      behavioral deficits (e.g., impairment in social cognition) do not necessarily
      imply convergent pathophysiological mechanisms, and that physiological measures
      may be useful for guiding etiological and interventional studies in neuropsychiatry.
